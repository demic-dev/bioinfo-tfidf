Use of chemotherapy to treat hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatic malignancies remain a global challenge. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for around 90% of patients with liver cancer and is the sixth most common neoplasm worldwide and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. However, the long-term prognosis for HCC remains far from satisfactory, with a late diagnosis and limited treatment. DOX has served as conventional chemotherapy with the longest history of use. Although conventional chemotherapy is being challenged by molecular therapy and immune therapy, there is renewed optimism and interest in both systematic and locoregional therapy. Combined chemotherapy is widely used in clinical practice. In specific terms, FOLFOX can serve as a first-line (category 2B) option as recommended by the 2021 NCCN guidelines, while the efficacy of LTLD plus RFA has been confirmed in the phase III HEAT study. These approaches have challenged the dominant status of molecular therapy in terms of health economics and they have potential benefits in Asia, where HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma is prevalent. Moreover, locoregional chemotherapy can be achieved with TACE and HAIC (possibly involving FOLFOX, DOX, mitomycin C, cisplatin, epirubicin, etc.). TACE was officially recommended by the 2021 NCCN guidelines for patients with Child-Pugh class B liver disease. In addition, HAIC has demonstrated a potential advantage in preliminary clinical practice, although it hasn't been included in any guidelines. Hence, this review summarizes large-scale trials and studies examining the development and innovative use of chemotherapeutic agents. Mounting clinical evidence warrants an exploration of the efficacy of chemotherapy."
Social inequalities and their impact on children's health: a current and global perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the consequences of social inequalities on children's health as a global and persistent problem, demonstrating its historical and structural roots in different societies. DATA SOURCES: Relevant articles in the PubMed/MEDLINE database, in addition to those found in a manual search and in the bibliographic references of selected studies and consultation to the websites of international organizations to obtain relevant data and documents. DATA SYNTHESIS: To understand how inequities affect health, it is necessary to know the unequal distribution of their social determinants among population groups. In the case of children, the parental pathway of determinants is central. The non-equitable way in which many families or social groups live, determined by social and economic inequalities, produces unequal health outcomes, particularly for children. This is observed between and within countries. Children from the most vulnerable population groups consistently have worse health conditions. Interventions aimed at children's health must go beyond care and act in an integrated manner on poverty and on social and economic inequalities, aiming to end systematic and unfair differences. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the considerable advances observed in children's health in recent decades at a global level, the inequalities measured by different indicators show that they persist. This scenario deserves attention from researchers and decision-makers, especially in the context of the global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has further intensified the situation of vulnerability and social inequalities in health around the world."
Interferon-gamma negatively regulates Th17-mediated immunopathology during mouse hepatitis virus infection,"Fulminant hepatitis can cause acute liver failure and death in both humans and mice. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the acute disease are still not well understood. Here, we examine the role of Th17 response in the development of the acute hepatitis following infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We show that IL-17 levels in serum are rapidly elevated and positively correlated to liver damage and death of the mice. In IFN-γR(−/−) mice, Th17 response is enhanced and the elevated IL-17 production contributes to severe liver damage as well as detrimental inflammation because neutralization of IL-17 effectively suppresses inflammation and protects mice from liver injury. We further show that IFN-γ facilitates antigen-induced apoptosis of Th17 cells and adoptive transferred IFN-γR(−/−), but not IFN-γR(+/+); CD4(+) T cells promotes an enhanced liver damage in wild-type mice. The results demonstrate an essential role of Th17 cells in MHV-induced immunopathology and the importance of IFN-γ in maintaining immune balance between Th1 and Th17 responses during acute viral infection. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00109-010-0711-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
160. The Protective Effect of Close Follow-up During the Pandemic on Adolescents With an Eating Disorder,
Evaluating short-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases among different epidemiological models under a Bayesian framework,"BACKGROUND: Forecasting of COVID-19 cases daily and weekly has been one of the challenges posed to governments and the health sector globally. To facilitate informed public health decisions, the concerned parties rely on short-term daily projections generated via predictive modeling. We calibrate stochastic variants of growth models and the standard susceptible-infectious-removed model into 1 Bayesian framework to evaluate and compare their short-term forecasts. RESULTS: We implement rolling-origin cross-validation to compare the short-term forecasting performance of the stochastic epidemiological models and an autoregressive moving average model across 20 countries that had the most confirmed COVID-19 cases as of August 22, 2020. CONCLUSION: None of the models proved to be a gold standard across all regions, while all outperformed the autoregressive moving average model in terms of the accuracy of forecast and interpretability."
Utilization of in- and outpatient hospital care in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic insights from the German-wide Helios hospital network,"BACKGROUND: During the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, reductions of hospital admissions with a focus on emergencies have been observed for several medical and surgical conditions, while trend data during later stages of the pandemic are scarce. Consequently, this study aims to provide up-to-date hospitalization trends for several conditions including cardiovascular, psychiatry, oncology and surgery cases in both the in- and outpatient setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using claims data of 86 Helios hospitals in Germany, consecutive cases with an in- or outpatient hospital admission between March 13, 2020 (the begin of the “protection” stage of the German pandemic plan) and December 10, 2020 (end of study period) were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period covering the same weeks in 2019. Cause-specific hospitalizations were defined based on the primary discharge diagnosis according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) or German procedure classification codes for cardiovascular, oncology, psychiatry and surgery cases. Cumulative hospitalization deficit was computed as the difference between the expected and observed cumulative admission number for every week in the study period, expressed as a percentage of the cumulative expected number. The expected admission number was defined as the weekly average during the control period. A total of 1,493,915 hospital admissions (723,364 during the study and 770,551 during the control period) were included. At the end of the study period, total cumulative hospitalization deficit was -10% [95% confidence interval -10; -10] for cardiovascular and -9% [-10; -9] for surgical cases, higher than -4% [-4; -3] in psychiatry and 4% [4; 4] in oncology cases. The utilization of inpatient care and subsequent hospitalization deficit was similar in trend with some variation in magnitude between cardiovascular (-12% [-13; -12]), psychiatry (-18% [-19; -17]), oncology (-7% [-8; -7]) and surgery cases (-11% [-11; -11]). Similarly, cardiovascular and surgical outpatient cases had a deficit of -5% [-6; -5] and -3% [-4; -3], respectively. This was in contrast to psychiatry (2% [1; 2]) and oncology cases (21% [20; 21]) that had a surplus in the outpatient sector. While in-hospital mortality, was higher during the Covid-19 pandemic in cardiovascular (3.9 vs. 3.5%, OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.06–1.15], P<0.01) and in oncology cases (4.5 vs. 4.3%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.01–1.11], P<0.01), it was similar in surgical (0.9 vs. 0.8%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.00–1.13], P = 0.07) and in psychiatry cases (0.4 vs. 0.5%, OR 1.01 [95% CI 0.78–1.31], P<0.95). CONCLUSIONS: There have been varying changes in care pathways and in-hospital mortality in different disciplines during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany. Despite all the inherent and well-known limitations of claims data use, this data may be used for health care surveillance as the pandemic continues worldwide. While this study provides an up-to-date analysis of utilization of hospital care in the largest German hospital network, short- and long-term consequences are unknown and deserve further studies."
Delayed presentation of acute coronary syndrome with mechanical complication during COVID-19 pandemic: a case report,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. We report a patient with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who presented late due to fears of contracting COVID-19. CASE SUMMARY: A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented late to the emergency department (ED) with AMI. He gave a 2-month history of exertional angina but avoided seeking medical consult due to fears of contracting COVID-19. On the day of admission, he had 4 h of severe chest pain before presenting to the ED. He was hypotensive and tachycardic on arrival. Electrocardiogram showed inferolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Chest radiograph revealed widened superior mediastinum and bedside echocardiogram revealed inferoseptal and inferolateral hypokinesia with features of cardiac tamponade. An urgent computed tomography aortogram showed possible left ventricular (LV) wall perforation with resulting haemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. Subsequent coronary angiogram showed 100% occlusion of mid left circumflex artery and a contained LV wall rupture was confirmed with LV ventriculogram. He was transferred to a tertiary centre and underwent successful emergency surgical repair. DISCUSSION: Our index case demonstrates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health seeking behaviour due to fears of contracting COVID-19 and the ensuing impact of delayed medical intervention. Cardiologists worldwide are seeing an alarming rate of rare complications of AMI in patients who present late. Physicians need to be aware of this phenomenon and have an active role to play in public education."
Chest radiographic score and lactate dehydrogenase are independent risk factors linked to mortality in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) patients,"BACKGROUND: Despite the dominance of Covid-19 in the current situation, MERS-CoV is found infrequently in the Middle East. When coupled with the chest radiographic score, serum biochemical parameters may be utilized to assess serum biochemical changes in individuals with different degrees of MERS-CoV infection and to predict death. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between increased LDH levels and severe MERS-CoV outcomes utilizing ventilation days and an elevated chest radiographic score. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included in the retrospective cohort. The mean age was 44.9 ± 13.5 years, while the range was between 12 and 73 years. With an average age of 53.3 ± 16.5 years, 18 of 57 (31.6%) patients were classified as deceased. The deceased group showed a substantially greater amount of LDH than the recovery group (280.18 ± 150.79 vs. 1241.72 ± 1327.77, p = 0.007). A cut-off value of > 512 LDH was established with a C-statistic of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92–1.00) and was 94% sensitive and 93% specific for mortality. Multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that log(e) (LDH) (adjusted HR: 9.91, 95% CI: 2.44–40.3, p = 0.001) and chest radiographic score (adjusted HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.05–1.47, p = 0.01) were risk factors for mortality, whereas ventilation days were a protective factor (adjusted HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.76–0.93, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: According to our results, blood LDH levels of > 512 had a 94% sensitivity and 93% specificity for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients infected with MERS-CoV. The chest radiographic score of 11.34 ± 5.4 was the risk factor for the mortality (adjusted Hazard ratio HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.05–1.47, p = 0.01). Thus, threshold may aid in the identification of individuals with MERS-CoV infection who die in hospital."

South Africa highlights materials in annual science forum,
COVID-19 higher morbidity and mortality in Chinese regions with lower air quality,"We investigated the geographical character of the COVID-19 infection in China and correlated it with satellite- and ground-based measurements of air quality. Controlling for population size, we found more viral infections in those areas afflicted by high Carbon Monoxide, formaldehyde, PM 2.5, and Nitrogen Dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for the incidence of this disease, similar to smoking. This suggests the detrimental impact of air pollution in these types of respiratory epidemics."
Utilization of Thromboelastogram and Inflammatory Markers in the Management of Hypercoagulable State in Patients with COVID-19 Requiring ECMO Support,"The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is evolving. Extracorporeal support independently confers an increased predilection for thrombosis, which can be exacerbated by COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. We present the successful management of a hypercoagulable state in two patients who required venovenous ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. This included monitoring inflammatory markers (D-dimer and fibrinogen), performing a series of therapeutic plasma exchange procedures, and administering high-intensity anticoagulation therapy and thromboelastography- (TEG-) guided antiplatelet therapy. TPE was performed to achieve goal D-dimer less than 3000 ng/mL D-dimer units (N ≤ 232 ng/mL D-dimer units) and goal fibrinogen less than 600 mg/dL (N = 200-400 mg/dL). These therapies resulted in improved TEG parameters and normalized inflammatory markers. Patients were decannulated after 37 days and 21 days, respectively. Post-ECMO duplex ultrasound of the upper and lower extremities and cannulation sites revealed a nonsignificant deep venous thrombosis at the site of femoral cannulation in patient 2 and no deep venous thrombosis in patient 1. The results of this case report show successful management of a hypercoagulable state among COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO support by utilization of inflammatory markers and TEG."

Cerebellar morphometric and spectroscopic biomarkers for Machado-Joseph Disease,"Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) or Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common form of dominant SCA worldwide. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) provide promising non-invasive diagnostic and follow-up tools, also serving to evaluate therapies efficacy. However, pre-clinical studies showing relationship between MRI-MRS based biomarkers and functional performance are missing, which hampers an efficient clinical translation of therapeutics. This study assessed motor behaviour, neurochemical profiles, and morphometry of the cerebellum of MJD transgenic mice and patients aiming at establishing magnetic-resonance-based biomarkers. (1)H-MRS and structural MRI measurements of MJD transgenic mice were performed with a 9.4 Tesla scanner, correlated with motor performance on rotarod and compared with data collected from human patients. We found decreased cerebellar white and grey matter and enlargement of the fourth ventricle in both MJD mice and human patients as compared to controls. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), NAA + N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAA + NAAG), Glutamate, and Taurine, were significantly decreased in MJD mouse cerebellum regardless of age, whereas myo-Inositol (Ins) was increased at early time-points. Lower neurochemical ratios levels (NAA/Ins and NAA/total Choline), previously correlated with worse clinical status in SCAs, were also observed in MJD mice cerebella. NAA, NAA + NAAG, Glutamate, and Taurine were also positively correlated with MJD mice motor performance. Importantly, these (1)H-MRS results were largely analogous to those found for MJD in human studies and in our pilot data in human patients. We have established a magnetic resonance-based biomarker approach to monitor novel therapies in preclinical studies and human clinical trials.

"A systematic review of substandard, falsified, unlicensed and unregistered medicine sampling studies: a focus on context, prevalence, and quality","Substandard and falsified (SF) medicines are a global issue contributing to antimicrobial resistance and causing economic and humanitarian harm. To direct law enforcement efficiently, halt the spread of SF medicines and antimicrobial resistance, academics, NGOs and government organisations use medicine quality sampling studies to estimate the prevalence of the problem. A systematic review of medicine quality studies was conducted to estimate how the methodological quality of these studies and SF prevalence has changed between 2013 and 2018. We also aimed to critique medicine sampling study methodologies, and the systematic review process which generates prevalence estimates. Based on 33 studies, the overall estimated median (Q1–Q3) prevalence of SF medicines appears to have remained high at 25% (7.7%–34%) compared with 28.5% in 2013. Furthermore, the methodological quality of prevalence studies has improved over the last 25 years. Definitive conclusions regarding the prevalence of SF medicines cannot be drawn due to the variability in sample sizes, consistency of design methods, and a lack of information concerning contextual factors affecting medicine quality studies. We contend that studies which present cumulative average prevalence figures are useful in a broad sense but could be improved to create more reliable estimates. We propose that medicine quality studies record the context of the study environment to allow systematic reviewers to compare like with like. Although, the academic rigour of medicine quality studies is improving, medicine sampling study limitations still exist. These limitations inhibit the accurate estimation of SF medicine prevalence which is needed to support detailed policy changes."
"SARS-CoV-2 Subgenomic RNAs: Characterization, Utility, and Perspectives","SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent at the root of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, harbors a large RNA genome from which a tiered ensemble of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) is generated. Comprehensive definition and investigation of these RNA products are important for understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. This review summarizes the recent progress on SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA identification, characterization, and application as a viral replication marker. The significance of these findings and potential future research areas of interest are discussed."
Smiles behind the masks: A systematic review and narrative synthesis exploring how family members of seriously ill or dying patients are supported during infectious disease outbreaks,"BACKGROUND: Infection control measures during infectious disease outbreaks can have significant impacts on seriously ill and dying patients, their family, the patient-family connection, coping, grief and bereavement. AIM: To explore how family members of patients who are seriously ill or who die during infectious disease outbreaks are supported and cared for during serious illness, before and after patient death and the factors that influence family presence around the time of death. DESIGN: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES: CINAHL, Medline, APA PsycInfo and Embase were searched from inception to June 2020. Forward and backward searching of included papers were also undertaken. Records were independently assessed against inclusion criteria. Included papers were assessed for quality, but none were excluded. FINDINGS: Key findings from 14 papers include the importance of communication and information sharing, as well as new ways of using virtual communication. Restrictive visiting practices were understood, but the impact of these restrictions on family experience cannot be underestimated, causing distress and suffering. Consistent advice and information were critical, such as explaining personal protective equipment, which family found constraining and staff experienced as affecting interpersonal communication. Cultural expectations of family caregiving were challenged during infectious disease outbreaks. CONCLUSION: Learning from previous infectious disease outbreaks about how family are supported can be translated to the current COVID-19 pandemic and future infectious disease outbreaks. Consistent, culturally sensitive and tailored plans should be clearly communicated to family members, including when any restrictions may be amended or additional supports provided when someone is dying."
Colliding worlds: Family carers’ experiences of balancing work and care in Ireland during the COVID‐19 pandemic,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic public health and social protective measures imposed globally resulted in partial or full closure of key services and supports for services and supports for people with a disability, chronic illness or age‐related dependency. This caused huge disruption to care provision and family carers were relied upon to assume this care at home. Many family carers, including those in employment, found themselves navigating additional care responsibilities without ‘usual levels’ of support from family, friends, work, school, day care services, homecare and community services. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on family carers, their employment and care‐giving responsibilities, through the lens of the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1989). Adopting a qualitative research approach, 16 family carers (14 females, 2 males) who were in employment prior to the onset of or during the pandemic, participated in an in‐depth, semi‐structured telephone or online video interview between June and September 2020. Interviews lasted between 45 and 100 min, were audio‐recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis of the interview data identified four main themes: colliding worlds; navigating unchartered waters alone; opportunity despite adversity and the relentless unknowing. Findings indicate that the onset of the pandemic resulted in the sudden loss of valued resources, which disrupted routines and caused care and work life domains to become intrinsically intertwined. Consistent with the main principles of the COR theory, adapting and transitioning to different ways of working and caring with depleted resources and supports, generated considerable stress for family carers and impacted their well‐being. The implications for employers, healthcare providers, policy makers and other key stakeholders are considered, to enable family carers to successfully reconcile work with care and protect their well‐being, as the pandemic continues to unfold and in the event of future societal crises."
"Employing Google Trends to Assess Concussion Search Popularity, Seasonality, and Association With High School Sports Participation","OBJECTIVE: This investigation employs 2004-2020 Google Trends data to correlate concussion search popularity and high school sports participation while assessing search seasonality and factors associated with search escalation. BACKGROUND: Events linked to concussions, from news to entertainment, altered public perception of concussions and discouraged high-risk activities. Such sentiment likely promoted high school football's 2004-2018 8% decrease in participation, despite simultaneous 8% increase for sports overall. Google Trends (GT) analysis calculates distinct subjects' popularity scores (0-100) by normalizing Google search frequency with other subjects in the same topic. With 35% of patients researching their conditions using Google, tracking concussion popularity scores allows robust analysis of event-driven fluctuation, seasonal variation, and sports impact. DESIGN/METHODS: Worldwide GT analysis was conducted for the disease topic ""Concussion"" with the categorical filter ""Health"" from 2004 to 2020. This period's monthly popularity scores with annual averages and annual high school sports participation data were subsequently obtained from Google Trends and the National Federation of State High School Associations, respectively. RESULTS: Concurrence of significant score changes with CTE studies' publication, release of 2015 film Concussion, and the COVID-19 pandemic validates GT's measurement of public interest. From 2006 to 2016, Pearson's correlation coefficients demonstrated strong negative correlation between GT popularity scores for ""Concussion"" with total number of high school football participants overall (R2 = 0.8553) and participants per school (R2 = 0.9533). Confirming football-related seasonality, one-way ANOVA regression analysis concluded 2004-2020's mean change in month-specific popularity score is not the same (p = 3.193E-08), and months during football season had statistically significant variability (September: p = 4.389E-05) with elevated average z-scores. CONCLUSIONS: Coupled with ANOVA regression and normalized analyses, strong negative correlations between concussion popularity score and high school football participation produce quantitative measures of a long-suspected relationship. Tracking concussion popularity and seasonality with Google Trends provides insight into how, when, and why patients are educating themselves online."
COVID-19 in Renal Transplant Patient Presenting With Active Typical Symptoms and Resolved Atypical Symptoms,"The novel coronavirus disease has brought the world to standstill with high infectivity and rapid transmission. The disease caused by novel coronavirus is termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We present the case of a renal transplant patient who was infected with COVID-19 through community spread and presented with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable because of the immunosuppressed state. These patients can shed a virus for a prolonged period and can have a higher load of the virus. There have been no COVID-19 cases transmitted through organ donation. Preinfection immunological impairment can aggravate the severity of the infection. The transplant team plays a crucial role in donor and recipient evaluation and guiding the timing of the transplant. Although specific published data are lacking with regard to transplant recipients, they should follow the same precautions as the general population, like avoiding nonessential travel and practice social distancing."
Leptospira – Zebra unter der „Coronaherde“,"This article reports an incidental finding of leptospirosis during a special consultation, which was initiated due to the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The focus on SARS-CoV‑2 and the uncharacteristic symptoms of these two diseases make it much more difficult to find the correct diagnosis. Leptospirosis is predominantly a tropical zoonosis but also occurs in Germany."
Tissue Tropism and Transmission Ecology Predict Virulence of Human RNA Viruses,"Novel infectious diseases continue to emerge within human populations. Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest model predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with 90.3% accuracy, compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection, having renal and/or neural tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R0 ≤ 1) human-to-human transmissibility were the strongest predictors of severe disease. We present a novel, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections. Newly emerging infectious diseases present potentially serious threats to global health. Although studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with the emergence of new human diseases, these do not address why emerging infections vary in the severity of disease they cause, often termed ‘virulence’. We test whether ecological traits of human viruses can act as predictors of virulence, as suggested by theoretical studies. We conduct the first systematic review of virulence across all currently known human RNA virus species. We adopt a machine learning approach by constructing a random forest, a model that aims to optimally predict an outcome using a specific structure of predictors. Predictions matched literature-assigned ratings for 28 of 31 test set viruses. Our predictive model suggests that higher virulence is associated with infection of multiple organ systems, nervous systems or the renal systems. Higher virulence was also associated with contact-based or airborne transmission, and limited capability to transmit between humans. These risk factors may provide novel starting points for questioning why virulence should evolve and identifying causative mechanisms of virulence. In addition, our work could suggest priority targets for infectious disease surveillance and future public health risk strategies. Comparative analysis using machine learning shows specificity of tissue tropism and transmission biology can act as predictive risk factors for virulence of human RNA viruses."
Coordination and optimization of PET/CT and COVID-19 vaccination; Lessons learned in the early stages of mass vaccination,"As the world embarks on mass vaccination for COVID-19, we are beginning to encounter unintended dilemmas in imaging oncology patients; particularly with regards to FDG PET/CT. In some cases, vaccine-related lymphadenopathy and FDG uptake on PET/CT can mimic cancer and lead to confounding imaging results. These cases with findings overlapping with cancer pose a significant dilemma for diagnostic purposes, follow-up, and management leading to possible treatment delays, unnecessary repeat imaging and sampling, and patient anxiety. These cases can largely be avoided by optimal coordination between vaccination and planned imaging as well as preemptive selection of vaccine administration site. This coordination hinges on patient, oncologist, and radiologists’ awareness of this issue and collaboration. Through close communication and patient education, we believe this will eliminate significant challenges for our oncology patients as we strive to end this pandemic."
Information theory applications for biological sequence analysis,"Information theory (IT) addresses the analysis of communication systems and has been widely applied in molecular biology. In particular, alignment-free sequence analysis and comparison greatly benefited from concepts derived from IT, such as entropy and mutual information. This review covers several aspects of IT applications, ranging from genome global analysis and comparison, including block-entropy estimation and resolution-free metrics based on iterative maps, to local analysis, comprising the classification of motifs, prediction of transcription factor binding sites and sequence characterization based on linguistic complexity and entropic profiles. IT has also been applied to high-level correlations that combine DNA, RNA or protein features with sequence-independent properties, such as gene mapping and phenotype analysis, and has also provided models based on communication systems theory to describe information transmission channels at the cell level and also during evolutionary processes. While not exhaustive, this review attempts to categorize existing methods and to indicate their relation with broader transversal topics such as genomic signatures, data compression and complexity, time series analysis and phylogenetic classification, providing a resource for future developments in this promising area."
SARS-COV-2 infection (coronavirus disease 2019) for the gastrointestinal consultant,"The current pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused an extreme burden for health care systems globally, and the number of cases is expected to continue to increase, at least in the immediate future. The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals. The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms. In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants. The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients. Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far. Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test. It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus."
COVID-19 und Palliativversorgung,"With knowledge, skills, and attitudes to treatment goal establishment and treatment decisions, palliative care can contribute to appropriate use of scare resources during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Palliative medicine also delivers recommendations on management of symptoms of breathlessness, anxiety, and restlessness, and provides concepts for communication with patients and their relatives/caregivers in spite of pandemic-related restrictions. In the national Palliative Care in Times of Pandemics (PallPan, https://pallpan.de/) project, 16 university palliative care centers have contributed to development of 32 recommendations, with best-practice examples for patients, relatives/caregivers, health care professionals, and decision-makers in the health care system. PallPan also includes recommendations for bereavement care in times of pandemic."

Impact of contact tracing on COVID-19 mortality: An impact evaluation using surveillance data from Colombia.,"Background Contact tracing is a key part of the public health surveillance toolkit. However, it is labor intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations to our knowledge have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country and provides data to support the expansion of contact tracing strategies with the aim of improving infection control. Methods We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N=54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). We proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified, as suggested by WHO guidelines. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. Results We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. Conclusion Contact tracing is instrumental to contain infectious diseases and its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will have a substantial impact on reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC."
The Orchestra of Reovirus Cell Entry,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: the ability of viruses to infect host cells is dependent on several factors including the availability of cell-surface receptors, antiviral state of cells, and presence of host factors needed for viral replication. Here we review findings from in vitro and in vivo studies using mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) that have identified an intricate group of molecules and mechanisms used by the virus to attach and enter cells. RECENT FINDINGS: recent findings provide an improved mechanistic understanding of reovirus cell entry. Of special note is the identification of a cellular mediator of cell entry in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, the effect of cell entry on the outcome of infection and cytopathic effects on the host cell, and an improved understanding of the components that promote viral penetration of cellular membranes. SUMMARY: a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between host and viral factors has enhanced our view of how viruses usurp cellular processes during infection."

Vitamin D Reverses Disruption of Gut Epithelial Barrier Function Caused by Campylobacter jejuni,"Infections by the zoonotic foodborne bacterium Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) are among the most frequent causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. The aim was to evaluate the relationship between epithelial barrier disruption, mucosal immune activation, and vitamin D (VD) treatment during C. jejuni infection, using intestinal epithelial cells and mouse models focused on the interaction of C. jejuni with the VD signaling pathway and VD treatment to improve C. jejuni-induced barrier dysfunction. Our RNA-Seq data from campylobacteriosis patients demonstrate inhibition of VD receptor (VDR) downstream targets, consistent with suppression of immune function. Barrier-preserving effects of VD addition were identified in C. jejuni-infected epithelial cells and IL-10(−/−) mice. Furthermore, interference of C. jejuni with the VDR pathway was shown via VDR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) interaction. Paracellular leakiness of infected epithelia correlated with tight junction (TJ) protein redistribution off the TJ domain and apoptosis induction. Supplementation with VD reversed barrier impairment and prevented inhibition of the VDR pathway, as shown by restoration of transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein (332 Da) permeability. We conclude that VD treatment restores gut epithelial barrier functionality and decreases bacterial transmigration and might, therefore, be a promising compound for C. jejuni treatment in humans and animals."
"How loneliness is talked about in social media during COVID-19 pandemic: Text mining of 4,492 Twitter feeds","BACKGROUND: Loneliness is a public health problem that is expected to rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, given the widespread policy of quarantine. The literature is unclear whether loneliness during COVID-19 is similar to those of non-pandemic seasons. This study examined the expression of loneliness on Twitter during COVID-19 pandemic, and identified key areas of loneliness across diverse communities. METHODS: Twitter was searched for feeds that were:(1) in English; (2) posted from May 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020; (3) posted by individual users (not organisations); and (4) contained the words ‘loneliness’ and ‘COVID-19’. A machine-learning approach (Topic Modeling) identified key topics from the Twitter feeds; Hierarchical Modeling identified overarching themes. Variations in the prevalence of the themes were examined over time and across the number of followers of the Twitter users. RESULTS: 4492 Twitter feeds were included and classified into 3 themes: (1) Community impact of loneliness during COVID-19; (2) Social distancing during COVID-19 and its effects on loneliness; and (3) Mental health effects of loneliness during COVID-19. The 3 themes demonstrated temporal variations. Particularly in Europe, Theme 1 showed a drastic reduction over time, with a corresponding rise in Theme 3. The themes also varied across number of followers. Highly influential users were more likely to talk about Theme 3 and less about Theme 2. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reflect close-to-real-time public sentiments on loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrated the potential usefulness of social media to keep tabs on evolving mental health issues. It also provides inspiration for potential interventions to address novel problems–such as loneliness–during COVID-19 pandemic."

Data-Driven Insights on the Effects of COVID-19 on Public Interest in Medical Aesthetics: Part II (Active Analysis),"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected financial and psychosocial factors that influence plastic surgery demand. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to actively assess public interest changes and the reasons underlying these shifts. METHODS: Using Amazons’ Mechanical Turk, we crowdsourced public opinions regarding aesthetic interventions from April 30 to May 3, 2020. The survey assessed prior experience with and interest in 6 aesthetic interventions before and during the pandemic and reasons for changing interest. United States residents aged 18 years and over who passed the attention check were included. RESULTS: We included 704 of 838 total responses. One-half of respondents were female; the median age group was 25 to 34 years. During the pandemic, 21% of respondents had increased and 33% decreased interest in at least one intervention. Non-invasive procedures (7.3%), facial aesthetic surgery (6.6%), and medical-grade skincare (5.9%) elicited the greatest interest increase. Seeing themselves in the mirror more often (43.2%), desire to look better after the crisis (41.8%), and increased time on social media (40.4%) were the top reasons for increased interest. The most common reasons for decreased interest were changing spending priorities (58%), focusing on other health aspects (49.8%), and worrying about infection in medical facilities (46.3%). Almost one-half of respondents considered virtual consultations for interventions of increased interest. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected interest in medical aesthetics. Offering telemedicine and discussing detailed COVID-19 infection control policies with patients will be critical to address patient needs and concerns. These findings can be used to improve patient outreach, advertisement, and counseling as practices focus on reopening."
Feasibility and Efficacy of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation following COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic affects a large number of patients with a rapid progression of respiratory failure often requiring hospitalization or intensive care unit treatment in some patients. Survivors of severe COVID-19 suffer from persistent weakness and cardiorespiratory failure. Feasibility and potential benefit of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CR) after COVID-19 remains unclear. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of COVID-19 patients in a single center inpatient rehabilitation clinic and describe performance and outcome during CR. Patients were referred from acute care hospitals for rehabilitation after severe COVID-19. The cohort (n=28) was divided in ventilated or not ventilated patients for further analysis. 50% were female, mean age was 66 years and patients stayed in the acute hospital for 19.3±10.7 days before referral for CR. 17 patients (61%) needed previous ICU treatment in the acute care hospital. Risk factors, assessments and questionnaires on admission were comparable in both groups. Significant enhancements were observed in 6-minute walking test and Feeling Thermometer which were independent of previous ventilation status. In conclusion, comprehensive CR following COVID-19 is safe, feasible and effective. Improvements in physical performance and subjective health status were independent of previous ventilation."
"Weathering the pandemic: How the Caribbean Basin can use viral and environmental patterns to predict, prepare and respond to COVID‐19","The 2020 coronavirus pandemic is developing at different paces throughout the world. Some areas, like the Caribbean Basin, have yet to see the virus strike at full force. When it does, there is reasonable evidence to suggest the consequent COVID‐19 outbreaks will overwhelm healthcare systems and economies. This is particularly concerning in the Caribbean as pandemics can have disproportionately higher mortality impacts on lower and middle income countries. Preliminary observations from our team and others suggest that temperature and climatological factors could influence the spread of this novel coronavirus, making spatiotemporal predictions of its infectiousness possible. This review studies geographic and time‐based distribution of known respiratory viruses in the Caribbean Basin in an attempt to foresee how the pandemic will develop in this region. This review is meant to aid in planning short‐ and long‐term interventions to manage outbreaks at the international, national and sub‐national levels in the region.

Proteolytic Cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and the Role of the Novel S1/S2 Site,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread from an initial outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 to the rest of the world within a few months. On March 11th 2020, the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation was characterized as a pandemic by the WHO. Much attention has been drawn to the origin of SARS-CoV-2, a virus which is related to the lineage B betacoronavirus SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses found in bat species. The closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 is a bat coronavirus named RaTG13 (BatCoV-RaTG13). Early characterizations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed the existence of a distinct 4 amino acid insert (underlined, SPRRAR↓S), found within the spike (S) protein, at a position termed the S1/S2 site located at the interface between the S1 receptor binding subunit and the S2 fusion subunit. Notably, this S1/S2 insert appears to be distinguishing feature among SARS-related sequences and introduces a potential cleavage site for the protease furin. Here, we investigate the potential role of this novel S1/S2 cleavage site and present direct biochemical evidence for proteolytic processing by a variety of proteases, including furin, trypsin-like proteases and cathepsins. We discuss these findings in the broader context of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, viral stability and transmission.Funding: Work in the author’s laboratory is supported by the National Institutes of Health (research grant R01AI35270)."
Proteomic Analysis of Vero Cells Infected with Pseudorabies Virus,"Suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV-1), known as pseudorabies virus (PRV), is one of the most devastating swine pathogens in China, particularly the sudden occurrence of PRV variants in 2011. The higher pathogenicity and cross-species transmission potential of the newly emerged variants caused not only colossal economic losses, but also threatened public health. To uncover the underlying pathogenesis of PRV variants, Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based proteomic analysis was performed to quantitatively screen the differentially expressed cellular proteins in PRV-infected Vero cells. A total of 7072 proteins were identified and 960 proteins were significantly regulated: specifically 89 upregulated and 871 downregulated. To make it more credible, the expression of XRCC5 and XRCC6 was verified by western blot and RT-qPCR, and the results dovetailed with the proteomic data. The differentially expressed proteins were involved in various biological processes and signaling pathways, such as chaperonin-containing T-complex, NIK/NF-κB signaling pathway, DNA damage response, and negative regulation of G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle. Taken together, our data holistically outline the interactions between PRV and host cells, and our results may shed light on the pathogenesis of PRV variants and provide clues for pseudorabies prevention."
Plastic Waste and the Environmental Crisis Industry,"Our relationship with plastic is complex. While the societal benefits of plastic are undeniable, plastic has also come to occupy a central role within a culture of waste and disposable living that constitutes a significant problem for health and the natural environment. Public awareness of the harms asociated with plastic is high, thanks, in part, to a range of sustained media exposure. This, however, has so far failed to materialize in any significant global reduction in plastic pollution. Meaningful regulatory change that adressess the harms of plastic at the point of production is curiously absent, while some apparent gains have been rolled back—against a backdrop of a global pandemic and a rehabilitation of plastic. This article highlights the assemblage of media, government and corporate interests that performs the role of what we identify as the “Environmental Crisis Industry” (“ECI”), which perpetuates stasis in the face of environmental catastrphe. The ECI manages our anxieties through media discourses of precarity and danger, while at the same time, offering us attainable “solutions” that exist well within the logic of consumer capitalism—in effect, compelling us (at least morally) to become eco-consumers. In this way, the political energy of grassroots climate resistance is “pre-corporated,” so to speak, into the product design of major corporations, dissipating the chance of real progressive change in favor of a new green spirit of capitalism."
Peripheral Artery Disease and COVID-19 Outcomes:Insights from the Yale DOM-CovX Registry,"BACKGROUND: : Both COVID-19 infection and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) cause hypercoagulability in patients, and it remains unknown whether PAD predisposes patients to experience worse outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: : The Yale DOM-CovX Registry consecutively enrolled inpatients for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2020, and November 10, 2020. Adjusted logistic regression models examined associations between PAD and mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, all endpoints combined). RESULTS: : Of the 3,830 patients were admitted with SARS-CoV-2, 50.5% were female, mean age was 63.1 ±18.4 years, 50.7% were minority race, and 18.3% (n = 693) had PAD. PAD was independently associated with increased mortality (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.11-1.88) and MACE (OR=1.48, 95% CI 1.16-1.87). PAD was not independently associated with stroke (p=0.06) and MI (p=0.22). CONCLUSION: : Patients with PAD have a >40% odds of mortality and MACE when admitted with a SARS-CoV-2, independent of known risk factors."

Home Health Staff Perspectives on Infection Prevention and Control: Implications for COVID-19,"Objectives The role of home healthcare (HHC) services in providing care to vulnerable, often frail individuals with chronic conditions is critical. Effective infection prevention and control (IPC) in HHC is essential to keeping both healthcare workers and patients safe, especially in the event of an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we explored successes and challenges with IPC from the perspectives of HHC staff. Design Qualitative descriptive study Setting and Participants From May to November 2018, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews with 41 staff from 13 agencies across the nation. Methods Transcripts were coded by a multidisciplinary coding team, and several primary and subcategories were identified using directed content analysis. Results Four primary categories were generated, including: 1) Uniqueness of Home Healthcare, 2) Infection Prevention and Control as a Priority, 3) Importance of Education, 4) Keys to Success and Innovation. Participants perceived that IPC plays a big part in patient safety and reducing rehospitalizations, and protection of patients and staff was a major motivator for compliance with IPC. The identified challenges included the unpredictability of the home environment, patient/family dynamics, the intermittent nature of HHC, and staffing issues. Education was seen as a tool to improve staff, patient, caregiver and families’ compliance with IPC. Keys to success and innovation included: a leadership focus on quality, using agency infection data to improve quality, and a coordinated approach to patient care. Conclusions and Implications This qualitative work identified barriers to effective IPC in HHC, as well as important facilitators that HHC agencies can use to implement policies and procedures to improve patient care and keep staff safe. Leadership prioritization of infection prevention and control is key to implementing appropriate infection prevention and control policies and may be especially important in midst of a crisis such as COVID-19."
Antibody Responses to 3rd Dose mRNA Vaccines in Nursing Home and Assisted Living Residents,"A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and the beta variant virus neutralization capacity between 2 and 3 mRNA vaccine series in nursing home residents, and between nursing home and assisted living residents strongly supports 3rd dose vaccine recommendations, and equivalent polices for nursing homes and assisted living settings. Findings suggest that residents mount a robust humoral response to a 3rd mRNA vaccination, and have greater neuralization capacity compared to a 2 dose series."

Limiting factors of face shield use for health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2, a highly transmissible and pathogenic viral infection, and was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Three months later, it became a severe pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To identify scientific evidence on the use of face shields by health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic period. METHOD: An integrative literature review of articles obtained from PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science databases was undertaken. For the search, controlled, non-controlled descriptors and specific keywords: ""face shield,"" ""fluid resistance procedure,"" ""respiratory infections,"" ""healthcare workers,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""aerosols,"" and ""personal protection infection"" were used. RESULTS: The sample comprised seven studies. The available evidence has shown that face shields do not have a defined standard for their production-their effectiveness depends on the quality of the visor, structure, and fixation system. They must be used as adjuvants to other personal protective equipment (PPE), and their isolated use is not recommended due to the fragilities of peripheral face sealing, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Due to the shortage of this equipment, domestic face shields can be indicated if they meet production requirements, based on scientific evidence for their efficient use."
Dysregulation of Leukocyte Trafficking in Type 2 Diabetes: Mechanisms and Potential Therapeutic Avenues,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and impaired insulin signaling which in addition to be caused by common metabolic dysregulations, have also been associated to changes in various immune cell number, function and activation phenotype. Obesity plays a central role in the development of T2DM. The inflammation originating from obese adipose tissue develops systemically and contributes to insulin resistance, beta cell dysfunction and hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia can also contribute to chronic, low-grade inflammation resulting in compromised immune function. In this review, we explore how the trafficking of innate and adaptive immune cells under inflammatory condition is dysregulated in T2DM. We particularly highlight the obesity-related accumulation of leukocytes in the adipose tissue leading to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction and resulting in hyperglycemia and consequent changes of adhesion and migratory behavior of leukocytes in different vascular beds. Thus, here we discuss how potential therapeutic targeting of leukocyte trafficking could be an efficient way to control inflammation as well as diabetes and its vascular complications."
Psychometric Properties of the PCS and the PCS-4 in Individuals With Musculoskeletal Pain,"BACKGROUND: The factor structure of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) has rarely been adequately analyzed (e.g., performing principal component analyses rather than factorial approximations). We aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PCS through a variety of exploratory and confirmatory factorial approaches. METHOD: Three hundred ninety-four Chilean patients with musculoskeletal pain were included (age, M = 49.61, SD = 18.00; 71.57% women). Eight factorial models were proposed to analyze the structure of the data. In addition, validity evidence of the PCS based on relationships with other variables were analyzed considering pain intensity and kinesiophobia. RESULTS: The results suggest a unidimensional structure. Models with more than one dimension exhibited undesirable factor loadings or inadequate indices of fit. Based on these results, a short version of the scale composed of 4 items is proposed (PCS-4). The PCS-4 scores demonstrated high levels of invariance between sex, chronicity, and education groups and also were associated with pain and kinesiophobia. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the PCS-4 Spanish version showed evidence of reliability and validity for adequately measuring pain catastrophizing in Chileans who suffer from musculoskeletal pain. The PCS-4 is a short form that should be explored in future studies (e.g., in other Spanish-speaking populations)."
Functional Performance and the Allen Cognitive Level Screen for Adults With Mental Illness: A Scoping Review,"IMPORTANCE: Research involving the use of the Allen Cognitive Level Screen (ACLS) in mental health practice has been available for more than 40 yr, yet there has been no comprehensive synthesis and review of this body of literature. OBJECTIVE: To review, summarize, compare, and evaluate the existing literature regarding the relationship between the ACLS and the functional and adaptive functional performance of adults living with mental illness. DATA SOURCES: Searches with no date limits were conducted in the CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and OTseeker databases. Study Selection and Data Collection: A five-stage scoping review methodology was used to examine peer-reviewed English-language literature reporting on the relationship between ACLS scores and functional and adaptive functional performance of adults with mental illness. Information from 15 studies was charted, collated, and numerically and thematically summarized. FINDINGS: A positive relationship between ACLS scores and in-the-moment performance was consistently reported. The relationship of ACLS scores to community living performance was less consistent. Methods of assessing performance, complexity of tasks assessed, and timing of assessments affected relationships with cognition as measured by ACLS. Gaps in the literature were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings raise questions about how, why, and when occupational therapists use the ACLS. Increased examination is needed of what aspects of performance and functional cognition reliably determine people's ability to live successfully in the community. What This Article Adds: This article provides the first synthesis of the existing literature on the relationship between ACLS scores and functional and adaptive functional performance of people living with mental illness."
Duration of infectious virus shedding in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 who required mechanical ventilation,"Background Approximately 5% of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 develop severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 requires respiratory management with mechanical ventilation and an extended period of treatment. Prolonged infectious virus shedding is a concern in severe COVID-19 cases, but few reports have examined the duration of infectious virus shedding. Therefore, we investigated the duration of infectious virus shedding in patients transferred to Hiroshima University Hospital with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Methods Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected and analyzed using both viral culture and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) tests between December 2020 and February 2021. Results Of the 23 patients tested, the proportions of those with positive test results at first specimen collection (the median number of days to first specimen collection after symptom onset was 10) on RT-qPCR and viral culture tests were 95·7% and 30·4%, respectively. All six patients with positive viral culture test results who were followed-up tested negative 24 days after symptom onset but remained positive on RT-qPCR. Viral loads based on PCR testing did not decrease over time, but those determined via culture tests decreased over time. The longest negative conversion time was observed in a dialysis patient on immunosuppressive drugs. Conclusions This study indicated that patients with severe COVID-19 remain culture positive for ≥ 10 days after symptom onset. Additionally, immunosuppressed patients with severe COVID-19 could consider isolation for ≥ 20 days."
IL-17A promotes Psoriasis-associated Keratinocyte Proliferation via ACT1-depedent Activation of YAP-AREG Axis,"Psoriasis is a recurrent inflammatory skin disorder characterized by epidermal hyperplasia which is primarily driven by interleukin (IL)-17A. The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway plays a vital role in cell survival and tissue growth, and its target gene, AREG, has been reported to promote the development of psoriasis. However, whether IL-17A promotes keratinocyte proliferation via regulating Hippo-YAP signaling has not been explored. Here, we show that the YAP-AREG pathway is activated in human psoriatic skin and is suppressed by IL-17A antagonist secukinumab and that IMQ and IL-17A administration activates the YAP-AREG axis in mice epidermis. In vitro studies using HaCaT and NHEK cells suggest that IL-17A enhances AREG expression and keratinocyte proliferation by activating Hippo-YAP signaling. Mechanistically, IL-17A stimulates the recruitment of MST1 to ACT1 in keratinocytes, which leads to reduced MST1-LATS1 interaction and YAP dephosphorylation. Together, our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism in which IL-17A promotes keratinocyte proliferation in psoriasis, namely through activating YAP-AREG signaling."

SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Expression In Vitro and Hematologic Effects in Mice Vaccinated With AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19),"Severe COVID-19 can be associated with a prothrombotic state, increasing risk of morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is purported to directly promote platelet activation via the S1 subunit and is cleaved from host cells during infection. High plasma concentrations of S1 subunit are associated with disease progression and respiratory failure during severe COVID-19. There is limited evidence on whether COVID-19 vaccine-induced spike protein is similarly cleaved and on the immediate effects of vaccination on host immune responses or hematology parameters. We investigated vaccine-induced S1 subunit cleavage and effects on hematology parameters using AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), a simian, replication-deficient adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine. We observed S1 subunit cleavage in vitro following AZD1222 transduction of HEK293x cells. S1 subunit cleavage also occurred in vivo and was detectable in sera 12 hours post intramuscular immunization (1x10(10) viral particles) in CD-1 mice. Soluble S1 protein levels decreased within 3 days and were no longer detectable 7–14 days post immunization. Intravenous immunization (1x10(9) viral particles) produced higher soluble S1 protein levels with similar expression kinetics. Spike protein was undetectable by immunohistochemistry 14 days post intramuscular immunization. Intramuscular immunization resulted in transiently lower platelet (12 hours) and white blood cell (12–24 hours) counts relative to vehicle. Similarly, intravenous immunization resulted in lower platelet (24–72 hours) and white blood cell (12–24 hours) counts, and increased neutrophil (2 hours) counts. The responses observed with either route of immunization represent transient hematologic changes and correspond to expected innate immune responses to adenoviral infection."
Sevoflurane in combination with esketamine is an effective sedation regimen in COVID-19 patients enabling assisted spontaneous breathing even during prone positioning,"BACKGROUND: Effective analgosedation for control of dyspnoea and for toleration of prone positioning (PP) in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is difficult to adjust. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of sedation with inhaled sevoflurane in combination with intravenous esketamine during PP in patients with COVID-19-ARDS (CARDS). METHODS: All mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to the departmental intensive care unit from March to June 2020 were included in this epidemiological cohort study. Patients were sedated with inhaled sevoflurane in combination with eske-tamine during PP and not or only lightly sedated during the supine position. Assisted spontaneous breathing was applied in both prone and supine position. RESULTS: Adverse events were documented prospectively, and routine ventilation parameters, hemodynamic parameters, Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) and sevoflurane consumption were monitored. Altogether, 146 episodes of PP in 15 patients were observed. No severe sedation-related event was observed during 2610 hours of PP. In 2498 hours (96%) patients were successfully converted to a pressure-supported spontaneous breathing mode. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled sedation with the AnaConDa-S-System (Sedana Medical AB, Danderyd, Sweden) alone is insufficient as soon as minute volume exceeds 7-8 L min-1, most likely due to technical reasons. Inhaled sedation with sevoflurane in combination with esketamine, however, safely enables prolonged prone positioning in patients with CARDS. Moreover, sedation depth was light enough to enable assisted spontaneous breathing during prone positioning."
A job for life: How the transition from education to employment predicts early mortality,
Covid-19 and its implications for the provision of gynecological services globally,"Covid-19 took the world by surprise and has completely changed the way humans live and work. There is hardly an aspect of life that has not been affected. Whether social, economic, physical, psychological, cultural or religious, this pandemic has revolutionized every aspect of our lives and some of these changes are here to stay for the unforeseeable time. Although much has been written about the negative effects of Covid-19 on our social lives, some technological advances on COVID-19 have profoundly affected various aspects of our lives. These are mostly to do with how we communicate, deliver health services, innovate and investigate new preventative measures and treatments, travel and indeed influenced the carbon footprint of the planet. Although most of gynaecology is elective and was therefore not considered a priority in the early phases of COVI-19, there are considerable consequences of delaying treatment for some of these elective conditions. Of particular importance are infertility, pre-malignant conditions, chronic pelvic pain, sexual disorders and those affecting the psychological and social aspects of women and families. The pandemic forced a rethink of how healthcare is delivered with wide adoption of remote/virtual consultation and triaging of clinical presentations. The rapid development of immunization and drugs against the virus was met with doubts by a large proportion of the population with reluctance to accept these. Consequently, there remains unvaccinated portions of both low and high-risk populations, some of whom may be denied access to gynaecological care. On the other hand, some pregnant women who are frightened of the impact of vaccination on pregnancy put their own lives at risk. While significant progress has been made to combat the pandemic, lessons about healthcare delivery (face-to-face versus virtual), education of the end users and introduction of new technologies into the development of drugs and vaccines must be evaluated and improved moving forward not only during the ongoing epidemic but with future outbreaks."
Structure-based drug repurposing for targeting Nsp9 replicase and spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"Drug re-purposing might be a fast and efficient way of drug development against the novel coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We applied a bioinformatics approach using molecular dynamics and docking to identify FDA-approved drugs that can be re-purposed to potentially inhibit the non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9) replicase and spike proteins in SARS-CoV-2. We performed virtual screening of FDA-approved compounds, including antiviral, anti-malarial, anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, anti-tuberculosis, and active phytochemicals against the Nsp9 replicase and spike proteins. Selected hit compounds were identified based on their highest binding energy and favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile. Conivaptan, an arginine vasopressin antagonist drug exhibited the highest binding energy (-8.4 Kcal/mol) and maximum stability with the amino acid residues present at the active site of the Nsp9 replicase. Tegobuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus, also exhibited maximum stability along with the highest binding energy (-8.1 Kcal/mol) at the active site of the spike proteins. Molecular docking scores were further validated by molecular dynamics using Schrodinger, which supported the strong stability of ligands with the proteins at their active sites through water bridges, hydrophobic interactions, and H-bonding. Our findings suggest Conivaptan and Tegobuvir as potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. Further in vitro and in vivo validation and evaluation are warranted to establish how these drug compounds target the Nsp9 replicase and spike proteins."

Assessment of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Safety Profiles: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have recently emerged as potential antiviral and immunomodulatory options for the treatment of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before June 20, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 23 and 19 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on 6 studies for CQ and 18 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published records involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n = 1,077 CQ, n = 1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 2,675 participants (n = 1,345 HCQ and n = 1,330 control). The overall mild and total AEs were significantly higher in CQ-treated non–COVID-19 patients, HCQ-treated non–COVID-19 patients, and HCQ-treated COVID-19 patients. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal (GI), dermatologic, and sensory AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo, while GI, dermatologic, sensory, and cardiovascular AEs were higher in HCQ-treated COVID-19 patients compared to control patients. Moreover, subgroup analysis suggested higher AEs with respect to dosage and duration in HCQ group. Data were acquired from studies with perceived low risk of bias, so plausible bias is unlikely to seriously affect the main findings of the current study. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ exhibited more AEs than participants taking placebo or control. Precautionary measures should be taken when using these drugs to treat COVID-19. The meta-analysis was registered on OSF (https://osf.io/jm3d9). REGISTRATION: The meta-analysis was registered on OSF (https://osf.io/jm3d9)."
Applicability of COVID-19 Pandemic Recommendations for Urology Practice: Data from Three Major Italian Hot Spots (BreBeMi),"Background Lombardy has been the first and one of the most affected European regions during the first and second waves of the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]). Objective To evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on all urologic activities over a 17-wk period in the three largest public hospitals in Lombardy located in the worst hit area in Italy, and to assess the applicability of the authorities’ recommendations provided for reorganising urology practice. Design, setting, and participants A retrospective analysis of all urologic activities performed at three major public hospitals in Lombardy (Brescia, Bergamo, and Milan), from January 1 to April 28, 2020, was performed. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Join-point regression was used to identify significant changes in trends for all urologic activities. Average weekly percentage changes (AWPCs) were estimated to summarise linear trends. Uro-oncologic surgeries performed during the pandemic were tabulated and stratified according to the first preliminary recommendations by Stensland et al (Stensland KD, Morgan TM, Moinzadeh A, et al. Considerations in the triage of urologic surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eur Urol 2020;77:663–6) and according to the level of priority recommended by European Association of Urology guidelines. Results and limitations The trend for 2020 urologic activities decreased constantly from weeks 8–9 up to weeks 11–13 (AWPC range –41%, –29.9%; p < 0.001). One-third of uro-oncologic surgeries performed were treatments that could have been postponed, according to the preliminary urologic recommendations. High applicability to recommendations was observed for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients with intermediate/emergency level of priority, penile and testicular cancer patients, and upper tract urothelial cell carcinoma (UTUC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients with intermediate level of priority. Low applicability was observed for NMIBC patients with low/high level of priority, UTUC patients with high level of priority, prostate cancer patients with intermediate/high level of priority, and RCC patients with low level of priority. Conclusions During COVID-19, we found a reduction in all urologic activities. High-priority surgeries and timing of treatment recommended by the authorities require adaptation according to hospital resources and local incidence. Patient summary We assessed the urologic surgeries that were privileged during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the three largest public hospitals in Lombardy, worst hit by the pandemic, to evaluate whether high-priority surgeries and timing of treatment recommended by the authorities are applicable. Pandemic recommendations provided by experts should be tailored according to hospital capacity and different levels of the pandemic."
Deep Venous Thrombosis after Ad26.COV2.S Vaccination in Adult Male,"With extensive loss of life and well-being seen since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the initiation of vaccinations has come with enormous hope towards the end of this pandemic. Detailed discussions regarding the safety and efficacy of these vaccines led to their approval. With such success, there have also been reports of vaccine-associated adverse events—allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, immune thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis. We discuss and report the first case of a healthy young adult male developing extensive thrombosis, after receiving the Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen) vaccine."

Ethnic and regional variation in hospital mortality from COVID-19 in Brazil,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is quickly spreading throughout Brazil, which is rapidly ascending the ranking of countries with the highest number of cases and deaths. A particularly unstable federal regime and fragile socioeconomic situation is likely to have contributed to the impact of the disease. Amid this crisis there is substantial concern in the possible socioeconomic, geopolitical and ethnic inequity of the impact of COVID-19 on the country's particularly diverse population. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using observational data from the SIVEP-Gripe dataset. We present descriptive statistics to quantify the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. We assess the importance of regional factors such as education, income and health either on a state-by-state basis or by splitting Brazil into a North and a Central-South region. Mixed-effects survival analysis was used to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. Findings: Our results show that, compared to branco comparators, hospitalised pardo and preto Brazilians have significantly higher risk of mortality, with hazard ratios and 95% CI of 1.47 (1.33-1.58) and 1.32 (1.15-1.52), respectively. In particular, pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age). We also found that hospitalised Brazilians in North regions tend to have more comorbidities than in the Central-South, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. Finally, we found that states in the North have a higher hazard ratio as compared to the Central-South, and that Rio de Janeiro obtained one of the highest hazard ratios, similar to the ones of the more underdeveloped Pernambuco and Amazonas. Interpretation: Our results can be interpreted according to the interplay of two independent, but correlated, effects: i) mortality by COVID-19 increases going North (vertical effect), ii) mortality increases for the pardo and preto population (horizontal effect). We speculate that the vertical effect is driven by increasing levels of comorbidity in Northern regions where levels of socioeconomic development are lower, whereas the horizontal effect may be related to lower levels of healthcare access or availability (including intensive care) for pardo and preto Brazilians. For most states the vertical and horizontal effects are correlated giving a larger cumulative mortality. However, Rio de Janeiro was found to be an outlier to this trend: It has an ethnicity composition (horizontal effect) similar to the states in the North region, despite high levels of socioeconomic development (vertical effect). Our analysis motivates an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect pardo and preto Brazilians as well as the population of poorer states from their higher death risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection."
The Effect of Implementing COVID-19 Infection Control Precautions on Conducting Simulation-Based Training Activities,"Introduction Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, onsite simulation training required infection control precautions. This study aimed to investigate the effect of implementing the infection control protocol on the participants' evaluation of simulation activities. Materials and methods The study included undergraduate female students from healthcare colleges in Princess Nourah University (PNU) who have attended simulation training events in the simulation and skills development center (SSDC). The study design was a cohort retrospective where data were retrieved from the SSDC participant evaluation database. The data included information related to participants' characteristics, simulation activities type, and learners' evaluation. The simulation activities included in the study were procedural simulation (PS) and full simulation (FS). Results The study included 837 subjects that were randomly chosen from January 2019 to December 2021. All participant's evaluations of simulation events conducted in the SSDC during the specified period were reviewed and randomly selected to be included in the study. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the activities were conducted under infection control protocol measures. There was a significant difference in evaluation results of FS and PS activities before and after implementing the COVID-19 infection control protocol (p-value < 0.001). Conclusion The study showed that conducting simulation activities in a simulation center under the infection control protocol does not negatively affect participants' evaluation of simulation events."
"In-house testing for COVID-19: effects on length of stay, isolation and the need for inpatient rehabilitation","ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare worldwide. Its direct complications, management and prognosis have been described. Downstream effects, including length of hospital stay (LOS), implications on discharge planning, and effect of in-house testing require formal study.MethodsA retrospective cohort study of patients suspected of COVID-19 infection admitted at a metropolitan Australian hospital was conducted. Outcomes before and after availability of in-house COVID-19 testing were compared.ResultsA total of 129 admissions were analysed. Indications for COVID-testing were dyspnoea (61.2%), fever (19.3%) and delirium (10.8%). All tested negative for COVID-19. Prior to in-house testing, mean LOS was 7.17 days (s.d. ± 4.2), and mean isolation of 1.8 days (s.d. ± 0.8). After availability of in-house testing, mean LOS was 4.78 days (s.d. ± 4.3) with mean isolation of 1.3 days (s.d. ± 0.9), both statistically significant differences. There were five inpatient falls, equivalent to 14.8 falls per 1000 patient/days. Twenty-two patients (17%) required subsequent sub-acute admission, 15 before in-house testing and five after (P = 0.058); however, a sub-group analysis for age >65 years was performed, and the results were significant (P < 0.05), showing all patients who required subacute admissions were aged >65.ConclusionIn-house COVID-19 testing is suggested to significantly reduce the duration patients spend in isolation and overall LOS in hospital. A shorter period of isolation and hospital LOS may reduce the need for subacute transfer in patients aged greater than 65 years, as well as the rates of inpatient falls. Large scale studies are needed to further elucidate these findings."
"Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Older Adults in London, UK","The COVID-19 pandemic is imposing a profound negative impact on the health and wellbeing of societies and individuals, worldwide. One concern is the effect of social isolation as a result of social distancing on the mental health of vulnerable populations, including older people. Within six weeks of lockdown, we initiated the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response Study, a bespoke survey of cognitively healthy older people living in London, to investigate the impact of COVID-19 and associated social isolation on mental and physical wellbeing. The sample was drawn from CHARIOT, a register of people over 50 who have consented to be contacted for aging related research. A total of 7,127 men and women (mean age=70.7 [SD=7.4]) participated in the baseline survey, May–July 2020. Participants were asked about changes to the 14 components of the Hospital Anxiety Depression scale (HADS) after lockdown was introduced in the UK, on 23(rd) March. A total of 12.8% of participants reported feeling worse on the depression components of HADS (7.8% men and 17.3% women) and 12.3% reported feeling worse on the anxiety components (7.8% men and 16.5% women). Fewer participants reported feeling improved (1.5% for depression and 4.9% for anxiety). Women, younger participants, those single/widowed/divorced, reporting poor sleep, feelings of loneliness and who reported living alone were more likely to indicate feeling worse on both the depression and/or anxiety components of the HADS. There was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people."
Etanercept-Induced Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Disease,"Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is a rare form of small-vessel vasculitis that typically causes rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with or without alveolar haemorrhage. Previously, there has only been one reported case of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antagonist-induced anti-GBM disease. Here, we describe the first reported case of etanercept-induced anti-GBM disease. A 55-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our tertiary specialist renal centre with a history of painless macroscopic haematuria. The patient has been receiving weekly etanercept injections over the past 12 months for psoriatic arthropathy. The serum immunology panel results highlighted a significantly raised anti-GBM titre (370.1 U). Etanercept was stopped, and the patient was empirically commenced on pulsed methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange. A renal biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis. Few days after admission, he tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and a decision was made to withhold cyclophosphamide. There was further decline in renal function with hyperkalaemia for which he received 2 sessions of haemodialysis. He was restarted on cyclophosphamide upon discharge. The patient was switched to rituximab treatment afterwards as he developed leucopenia 2 weeks following the commencement of cyclophosphamide. The serum creatinine level continued to improve and remained dialysis-independent. In conclusion, with the increased use of etanercept and other TNF-α antagonists, the prescribing clinician must be aware of the rare but life-threatening drug-induced vasculitis. We recommend careful monitoring of renal indices with the use of this class of medications."
The T cell receptor repertoire reflects the dynamics of the immune response to vaccination,"Early, high-resolution metrics are needed to ascertain the immune response to vaccinations. The T cell receptor (TCR), a heterodimer of one α and one β chain, is a promising target, with the complete TCR repertoire reflecting the T cells present in an individual. To this end, we developed Tseek, an unbiased and accurate method for profiling the TCR repertoire by sequencing the TCR α and β chains and developing a suite of tools for repertoire analysis. An added advantage is the ability to non-invasively analyze T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Tseek and the analytical suite were used to explore the T cell response to both the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (n=9) and the seasonal inactivated Influenza vaccine (n=5) at several time points. Neutralizing antibody titers were also measured in the covid vaccine samples. The COVID-19 vaccine elicited a broad T cell response involving multiple expanded clones, whereas the Influenza vaccine elicited a narrower response involving fewer clones. Many distinct T cell clones responded at each time point, over a month, providing temporal details lacking in the antibody measurements, especially before the antibodies are detectable. In individuals recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the first vaccine dose elicited a robust T cell response, while the second dose elicited a comparatively weaker response, indicating a saturation of the response. The physical symptoms experienced by the recipients immediately following the vaccinations were not indicative of the TCR/antibody responses. The TCR responses broadly presaged the antibody responses. We also found that the TCR repertoire acts as an individual fingerprint: donors of blood samples taken years apart could be identified solely based upon their TCR repertoire, hinting at other surprising uses the TCR repertoire may have. These results demonstrate the promise of TCR repertoire sequencing as an early and sensitive measure of the adaptive immune response to vaccination, which can help improve immunogen selection and optimize vaccine dosage and spacing between doses."

Control Strategies for a Multi-strain Epidemic Model,"This article studies a multi-strain epidemic model with diffusion and environmental heterogeneity. We address the question of a control strategy for multiple strains of the infectious disease by investigating how the local distributions of the transmission and recovery rates affect the dynamics of the disease. Our study covers both full model (in which case the diffusion rates for all subgroups of the population are positive) and the ODE–PDE case (in which case we require a total lock-down of the susceptible subgroup and allow the infected subgroups to have positive diffusion rates). In each case, a basic reproduction number of the epidemic model is defined and it is shown that if this reproduction number is less than one then the disease will be eradicated in the long run. On the other hand, if the reproduction number is greater than one, then the disease will become permanent. Moreover, we show that when the disease is permanent, creating a common safety area against all strains and lowering the diffusion rate of the susceptible subgroup will result in reducing the number of infected populations. Numerical simulations are presented to support our theoretical findings."
Passive Immunization: Toward Magic Bullets,"Whereas active immunity refers to the process of exposing the individual to an antigen to generate an adaptive immune response, passive immunity refers to the transfer of antibodies from one individual to another. Passive immunity provides immediate but short-lived protection, lasting several weeks up to 3 or 4 months. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta or from breast milk to the gut of the infant. It can also be produced artificially, when antibody preparations derived from sera or secretions of immunized donors or, more recently, different antibody producing platforms are transferred via systemic or mucosal route to nonimmune individuals. Passive immunization has recently become an attractive approach because of the emergence of new and drug-resistant microorganisms, diseases that are unresponsive to drug therapy and individuals with an impaired immune system who are unable to respond to conventional vaccines. This chapter addresses the contributions of natural and artificial acquired passive immunity in understanding the concept of passive immunization. We will mainly focus on administration of antibodies for protection against various infectious agents entering through mucosal surfaces."

"Antibiofilm activity of the biosurfactant and organic acids against foodborne pathogens at different temperatures, times of contact, and concentrations.","Biofilm formation has been suggested to play a significant role in the survival of pathogens in food production. Interest in evaluating alternative products of natural origin for disinfectant use has increased. However, there is a lack of information regarding the effects of biosurfactants and organic acids on Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni biofilms, mainly considering temperatures found in environments of poultry processing, as well as simulating the contact times used for disinfection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of rhamnolipid, malic acid, and citric acid on the adhesion of S. Enteritidis, E. coli, and C. jejuni on polystyrene surfaces at different temperatures (4, 12, and 25 °C), compound concentrations, and times of contact (5 and 10 min), and to analyze the potential use of these compounds to disrupt formed biofilms. All three compounds exhibited antibiofilm activity under all analyzed conditions, both in the prevention and removal of formed biofilms. Contact time was less important than temperature and concentration. The antibiofilm activity of the compounds also varied according to the pathogens involved. In the food industry, compound selection must consider the temperature found in each stage of product processing and the target pathogens to be controlled."
Global collaboration and social practices to mitigate impacts of COVID-19 in the world: a lived experience of infecting,"COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most serious threatening conditions and the complex situation in the recent century, which shook the world. This unprecedented crisis has caused many disruptions and distractions for humans in different local and global levels. This reflexive essay aims to review challenges and opportunities originated by the Corona-virus pandemic within social groups through a moral perspective. Focusing on both negative and positive aspects would help us find the required skills and strategies to adapt to the crises and mitigate the issues based on our capacities and resources."
Common Variable Immunodeficiency Associated with a De Novo IKZF1 Variant and a Low Humoral Immune Response to the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine,"Background and Aims: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) comprises a group of diseases with heterogeneous clinical and immunological manifestations. Several mutations have been identified in genes encoding proteins essential for immune function. Our aim was to phenotypically and genotypically characterize a patient diagnosed with CVID and study his response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Methods: We performed a next-generation sequencing analysis, a CMIA, and an ELISA to analyze the humoral and cellular response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, respectively. We also employed flow cytometry and immunoturbidimetry to assess the patient’s global immune status. Results: We found a low humoral but positive cellular response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. NGS screening revealed a transition from guanine to adenine at position c.485 of the IKZF1 gene in heterozygosity, giving rise to the R162Q variant, which was not present in his parents. Conclusions: The R162Q variant of the IKZF1 gene has been associated with CVID type 13, but always with an autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance. Therefore, we present for the first time a case of CVID associated with a de novo heterozygous R162Q variant in the IKZF1 gene in a patient with a low humoral immune response to the complete COVID-19 vaccination program."
Evolving Practice Patterns in Singapore's Public Sector Ophthalmology Centers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since become a global pandemic. Singapore was one of the first countries outside of China to be affected and reported its first case in January 2020. Strategies that were deployed successfully during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome have had to evolve to contain this novel coronavirus. Like the rest of the health care services in Singapore, the practice of ophthalmology has also had to adapt to this rapidly changing crisis. This article discusses the measures put in place by the 3 largest ophthalmology centers in Singapore's public sector in response to COVID-19, and the challenges of providing eye care in the face of stringent infection control directives, staff redeployments and “social distancing.” The recently imposed “circuit breaker,” effectively a partial lockdown of the country, has further limited our work to only the most essential of services. Our staff are also increasingly part of frontline efforts in the screening and care of patients with COVID-19. However, this crisis has also been an opportunity to push ahead with innovative practices and given momentum to the use of teleophthalmology and other digital technologies. Amidst this uncertainty, our centers are already planning for how ophthalmology in Singapore will be practiced in this next stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond."
Cardiac performance in patients hospitalized with COVID‐19: a 6 month follow‐up study,"AIMS: Myocardial injury is frequently observed in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pneumonia. Different cardiac abnormalities have been reported during the acute COVID‐19 phase, ranging from infra‐clinic elevations of myocardial necrosis biomarkers to acute cardiac dysfunction and myocarditis. There is limited information on late cardiac sequelae in patients who have recovered from acute COVID‐19 illness. We aimed to document the presence and quantify the extent of myocardial functional alterations in patients hospitalized 6 months earlier for COVID‐19 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective echocardiographic evaluation of 48 patients (mean age 58 ± 13 years, 69% male) hospitalized 6 ± 1 month earlier for a laboratory‐confirmed and symptomatic COVID‐19. Thirty‐two (66.6%) had pre‐existing cardiovascular risks factors (systemic hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidaemia), and three patients (6.2%) had a known prior myocardial infarction. Sixteen patients (33.3%) experienced myocardial injury during the index COVID‐19 hospitalization as identified by a rise in cardiac troponin levels. Six months later, 60.4% of patients still reported clinical symptoms including exercise dyspnoea for 56%. Echocardiographic measurements under resting conditions were not different between patients with versus without myocardial injury during the acute COVID‐19 phase. In contrast, low‐level exercise (25W for 3 min) induced a significant increase in the average E/e′ ratio (10.1 ± 4.3 vs. 7.3 ± 11.5, P = 0.01) and the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (33.4 ± 7.8 vs. 25.6 ± 5.3 mmHg, P = 0.02) in patients with myocardial injury during the acute COVID‐19 phase. Sensitivity analyses showed that these alterations of left ventricular diastolic markers were observed regardless of whether of cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiac diseases indicating SARS‐CoV‐2 infection as a primary cause. CONCLUSIONS: Six months after the acute COVID‐19 phase, significant cardiac diastolic abnormalities are observed in patients who experienced myocardial injury but not in patients without cardiac involvement."
Advances in PTSD Treatment Delivery: Review of Findings and Clinical Considerations for the Use of Telehealth Interventions for PTSD,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Effective treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remain underutilized and individuals with PTSD often have difficulty accessing care. Telehealth, particularly clinical videoconferencing (CVT), can overcome barriers to treatment and increase access to care for individuals with PTSD. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature on the delivery of PTSD treatments through office-based and home-based videoconferencing, and outline areas for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence-based PTSD treatments delivered through office-based and home-based CVT have been studied in pilot studies, non-randomized trials, and randomized clinical trials. The studies have consistently demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of these modalities as well as significant reduction in PTSD symptoms, non-inferior outcomes, and comparable dropout rates when compared with traditional face-to-face office-based care. Finally, it has been shown that using CVT does not compromise the therapeutic process. SUMMARY: Office-based and home-based CVT can be used to deliver PTSD treatments while retaining efficacy and therapeutic process. The use of these modalities can increase the number of individuals that can access efficacious PTSD care."
Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care unit,"OBJECTIVES: Superinfections in patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU) are an important and challenging complication, also in COVID-19. However, no definitive data are available about the role of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) in COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-center, cross-sectional study including patients with MDR-AB infections admitted to ICU with or without COVID-19, between January 2019 and January 2021. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate risk factor for MDR-AB infections in ICU patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or other etiology. The secondary endpoints were 30-days mortality in all study population and risk factors associated with development of bloodstream infection (BSI). RESULTS: During the study period 32 adults with COVID-19 were enrolled and compared with 115 patients admitted in the same ICU for other reasons. We observed a total of 114 deaths, with a survival rate of 29.3%: 18.8% in COVID-19 and 32.2% in control group. Relative risk for MDR-AB infection in COVID-19 showed that serum lactate levels mmol/l > 2, Acinetobacter baumannii colonization, BSI and steroid therapy were observed more frequently in COVID-19 patients. Cox regression analysis showed that serum lactate levels > 2 mmol/l, Acinetobacter baumannii colonization, BSI, and steroid therapy were associated with 30-days mortality. Finally, patients with COVID-19, white blood cells count > 11,000 mm(3), serum lactate levels > 2 mmol/l, infections at time of ICU admission, Acinetobacter baumannii colonization, and steroid therapy were independently associated with development of BSI. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the impact of BSI on outcome, the role of Acinetobacter baumannii colonization and the use of steroids on the risk to develop MDR-AB infections also during COVID-19."
Global research trends of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: a bibliometric analysis,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus that causes severe viral pneumonia in humans, known to have a high mortality rate and a similarity in clinical symptoms with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and after that, MERS-CoV exhibited outbreaks in several regions of the world. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of publications involving MERS-CoV at global level by using a bibliometric analysis. METHODS: Scopus database was searched on March 4, 2016 for MERS-CoV publications published between 2012 and 2015. It was performed on the same day in order to avoid the possible bias came from update on the database because the metrics are changing over time. All publication types were considered; however publications as errata were excluded. Analysis parameters include year of publication, publication type, patterns of international collaboration, research institutions, journals, impact factor, h-index, language, and times cited. RESULTS: A total of 883 MERS-CoV research publications were published across the world. The MERS-CoV-associated publications were originated from 92 countries/territories, indicating the international spread of MERS-CoV research. The USA was the largest contributor, with 319 articles published over 4 years, followed by KSA (113 articles). The total number of citations for these publications has already achieved 8,015, with an average of 9.01 citations per each publication. The h-index for MERS-CoV-associated publications was 48. The USA also have the highest h-index (32), followed by KSA (26) and UK (22). Netherland produced the greatest proportion of publications with international research collaboration (72.7 %) followed by the UK (71 %) and Germany (69.1 %) out of the total number of publications for each country. CONCLUSIONS: There is a rapid increase in research activities related to MERS-CoV from 2012 to 2015. This study demonstrates that the MERS-CoV related literature has grown to be more extensive and global over the past 4 years. The bulk of publications in the field of MERS-CoV research are published by high-income countries such as the USA. Furthermore, the USA, the UK and KSA may have higher quality of articles according to the value of h-index."

Paeoniflorin Rescued MK-801-Induced Schizophrenia-Like Behaviors in Mice via Oxidative Stress Pathway,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) affects approximately 1% population worldwide, and the first-line antipsychotics have partial reactivity or non-reactivity with side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find more effective drugs. Paeoniflorin (PF) is the main effective component of traditional Chinese medicine from white peony, red peony and peony bark, which acts as a neuroprotective agent. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether PF can rescue MK-801 induced schizophrenia-like behavior in mice. Our results demonstrated that intragastric administration of PF ameliorated MK-801 induced schizophrenia-like behaviors in mice as demonstrated by prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response, fear conditioning test for memory and open field test for activity. In contrast, the first-line antipsychotics-olanzapine reversed the prepulse inhibition deficits and hyperactivities, but not memory deficits, in the model mice. Further analysis showed that PF reduced oxidative stress in the MK-801-treated mice, as evidenced by the increased superoxide dismutase levels and decreased malondialdehyde levels in the blood of the model mice. In addition, PF treatment inhibited the expression of the apoptotic protein Bax and restored the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the brains of the model mice. in vitro data indicated that PF protected against oxidative stress induced neurotoxicity in the primary cultured hippocampal neurons. In conclusion, our results were the first to provide evidence that PF rescued schizophrenia-like behaviors (both positive symptoms and cognitive impairments) in rodents through oxidative stress pathway, and therefore provide a novel strategy for treatment of SCZ. However, more pre-clinical and clinical research are needed to translate the present findings into clinics for a treatment of schizophrenia."
Novel coronavirus disease in patients with end‐stage kidney disease,"The novel coronavirus disease outbreak started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread rapidly worldwide. As almost all patients with end‐stage kidney disease have been treated with HD in Japan, they have a higher risk of infection than the healthy population. Moreover, the complications of renal failure, such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, appear to be a risk factor of death owing to novel coronavirus disease. The reported morbidity and mortality rates of novel coronavirus disease are significantly higher in dialysis patients than in the healthy population. No treatment for novel coronavirus disease has yet been developed; thus, countermeasures to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease in dialysis facilities must be rapidly established. The latest findings on novel coronavirus disease in patients with end‐stage kidney disease and the guidelines for countermeasures against the spread of novel coronavirus disease worldwide are summarized in this review."
Diagnostic performance of chest CT in screening patients with suspected COVID-19 infection in a Western population,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic performance of chest CT in screening patients suspected of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Western population. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent chest CT because of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were included. CT scans were prospectively evaluated by frontline general radiologists who were on duty at the time when the CT scan was performed and retrospectively assessed by a chest radiologist in an independent and blinded manner. Real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction was used as reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of the frontline general radiologists were compared to those of the chest radiologist using the McNemar test. RESULTS: 56 patients were included. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the frontline general radiologists were 89.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 71.8%, 97.7%], 32.1% (95% CI: 15.9%, 52.4%), 56.8% (95% CI: 41.0%, 71.7%), and 75.0% (95% CI: 42.8%, 94.5%), respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the chest radiologist were 89.3% (95% CI: 71.8%, 97.7%), 75.0% (95% CI: 55.1%, 89.3%), 78.1% (95% CI: 60.0%, 90.7%), and 87.5% (95% CI: 67.6%, 97.3%), respectively. Sensitivity was not significantly different (p = 1.000), but specificity was significantly higher for the chest radiologist (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Chest CT interpreted by frontline general radiologists achieves insufficient screening performance. Although specificity of a chest radiologist appears to be significantly higher, sensitivity did not improve. A negative chest CT result does not exclude COVID-19. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our study shows that chest CT interpreted by frontline general radiologists achieves insufficient diagnostic performance to use it as an independent screening tool for COVID-19. Although specificity of a chest radiologist appears to be significantly higher, sensitivity is still insufficiently high."
Principles of conducting cardiac anaesthesia services in COVID-19 pandemic,
Home treatment of single cutaneous warts combining face-to-face and teledermatology consultation: A new perspective,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, teledermatology services were set up and enhanced to take care of those benign conditions like cutaneous warts (CWs) which, if undiagnosed or treated with delay, could have worsened, enlarged, and potentially spread to the community. The aim of this hybrid exploratory trial was to combine face-to-face clinical and dermoscopic evaluation with teledermatology follow-up in the management of CWs with a cryogenic pen based on nitrous oxide for home treatment. Twelve adult patients affected by CWs were enrolled. During the first face-to-face visit, single CWs were selected for the study by clinical and dermoscopic evaluation. The home schedule consisted of one application to be repeated after 2 weeks, when signs of CWs were still evident. Patients were also asked to send a clinical photo of the treated lesion at weekly intervals. A final face-to-face evaluation was scheduled to verify the response to home treatment by clinical and dermoscopy evaluation. A total of 20 CWs located on the trunk and the extremities were treated: a complete clinical and dermoscopic resolution was observed in 16 out of 20 lesions (80%), and a partial response in two cases. The adverse events observed during treatment were comparable to those normally observed with cryotherapy of CWs. In conclusion, home treatment of CWs with the cryogenic pen, that should be always preceded by dermatologist diagnosis and prescription, is safe and effective, especially if combined with face-to-face and teledermatology consultations, pointing out its important role during pandemic times or in any other environmental limitations that may impair the access to medical care services. The combination of face-to-face consultations for initial and final visits and teledermatology during the treatment phase could represent a model for other dermatologic conditions as well (e.g., acne, rosacea, psoriasis, atopic eczema etc.)."
Parkinson's disease patients' needs during the COVID‐19 pandemic in a red zone: A framework analysis of open‐ended survey questions,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During the first phase of the COVID‐19 pandemic, a lockdown was imposed in Italy. The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions, feelings and unmet needs of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who experienced the 2‐month lockdown in a “red zone” in the northern part of Italy during the COVID‐19 outbreak. METHODS: The study had a descriptive design that used a cross‐sectional online survey which included open‐ended questions to elicit responses on the participant's feelings concerning their risk of contracting coronavirus, how their physical activity had changed, and their personal needs, dictated by their condition, which were not met in this pandemic period as compared to previous periods. Demographic data were analysed using descriptive frequencies, while the open‐ended questions were analysed using thematic framework analysis. RESULTS: The study included 103 participants (63 men/40 women [61.17 vs. 38.83%]). Framework analysis led to the identification of four main themes: (i) fearing the risk of contracting coronavirus; (ii) reduction of physical activity; (iii) perception of the risk of not being able to access outpatient clinics or support services; and (iv) negative experiences of the important reduction in socialization. The perceptions of unmet needs appeared to be greater than the actual experience, particularly for the reduction in physical activity and the interruption of contacts with the neurologist and other specialists. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how perceptions and actual experience shape the meaning of living with PD during the pandemic. Worth noting is the divergence between perceptions and real impact in some aspects of the COVID‐19 outbreak."
La maladie à coronavirus COVID-19 en Afrique subsaharienne : la place de la santé au travail,"Résumé Le milieu de travail africain subsaharien pour faire face à la pandémie à COVID-19, doit s’appuyer sur les missions de la santé au travail au niveau du secteur structuré et la promotion du bien-être et de la santé au travail pour le secteur informel. Les mesures de prévention technique collective (sensibilisation, formation, propreté), individuelle (équipements de protection individuelle, vaccination) et de prévention médicale (dépistage, surveillance) rejoignent les recommandations préconisées par les autorités. Summary In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the workplace in Sub-Saharan Africa should build on the missions of occupational health in the formal sector and on the promotion of well-being and occupational health in the informal sector. Technical prevention measures adopted at the collective level (awareness-raising, training and hygiene) and at the individual level (personal protective equipment and vaccination) as well as disease prevention measures (screening and surveillance) are in line with the recommendations advocated by the authorities."
Energy-Efficient and Secure Opportunistic Routing Protocol for WSN: Performance Analysis with Nature-Inspired Algorithms and Its Application in Biomedical Applications.,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) is made up of tiny sensor nodes. The application of WSN in diverse fields has seen a tremendous escalation in recent years. WSN applications are constrained by the limited set of computing resources possessed by the sensor nodes and the security aspects of data communication in the WSN. Many algorithms based on nature-inspired optimization (NIO) have been proposed in the past to optimize the issue of energy efficiency and security in WSN. In the proposed work, two opportunistic routing algorithms, i.e., intelligent opportunistic routing protocol (IOP) and trust-based secure intelligent opportunistic routing protocol (TBSIOP), are compared against two NIO algorithms developed for achieving energy efficiency and security in WSN for performance analysis. The performance is evaluated by simulating the algorithms on MATLAB and comparing the obtained results with existing ACO-based and PSO-based routing algorithms. It is observed that the TBSIOP outperforms the NIO-based algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and average risk level. All the parameters under consideration are recorded in the presence of a maximum of 50% malicious nodes for 25, 50, and 100 nodes' test cases. The increasing size of the network has a significant effect on the performance of TBSIOP, as the packet delivery ratio is close to 100%. Also, TBSIOP can easily avoid malicious nodes during the routing process as reflected from the results. This will improve the network lifetime of TBSIOP compared to other protocols. As far as the application of the work is concerned, it would be beneficial for smart healthcare services. It can also help in better communication during the sharing of data by providing energy-efficient services and keeping the network alive for a longer period."
Examining the Relationship Between Basic Psychological Needs and Athlete Identity During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"OBJECTIVES: During COVID-19 athletes have had games canceled, seasons postponed, and social supports lost. These changes negatively impact their motivation, and potentially identity, as athletes. We draw on self-determination theory to examine motivation in sport and its relationship with athlete identity during COVID-19. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design was employed consisting of online quantitative surveys. METHOD: We gathered background engagement and motivation data from 115 athletes involved in organized sport. They responded to questions on basic psychological needs satisfaction (competence, relatedness, autonomy) and athlete identity. RESULTS: When reflecting on their basic psychological needs during the pandemic, most athletes considered them important. Athletes' competence and relatedness in sport were associated with social-related athlete identity, but not autonomy. Only relatedness in sport was associated with exclusivity-related social identity. CONCLUSIONS: Using a self-determination theoretical lens, our findings contribute to understanding athlete motivation and identities when sport is interrupted."
Substernal goitre presenting with upper and lower extremity oedema,"Substernal goitre is characterised by compressive symptoms of the airway and oesophagus. Chronic, progressive symptoms usually result in surgical removal. We report a rare presentation of substernal goitre in a male in his early 70s who suffered from severe bilateral lower extremity (LE) lymphoedema, resulting in immobility and nursing home placement, and left upper extremity lymphoedema. Our initial assessment led to a filariasis work-up, which was negative, due to the patient's prior 2-year residence in India and service overseas. Chest CT scan revealed an incidental substernal goitre extending posterior to the left innominate vein and aortic arch to the level of the left mainstem bronchus. The patient underwent a left hemithyroidectomy via cervical excision and sternotomy and had an uneventful recovery with resolution of lymphoedema and mobility. Despite extensive literature regarding clinical presentations of substernal goitre, severe lymphoedema of the LE is not a well-established association."

"Tutorial. A Behavioral Analysis of Rationality, Nudging, and Boosting: Implications for Policymaking","As recent trends in policymaking call for increased contributions from behavioral science, nudging and boosting represent two effective and relatively economic approaches for influencing choice behavior. They utilize concepts from behavioral economics to affect agents’ concurrent suboptimal choices: in principle, without applying coercion. However, most choice situations involve some coercive elements. This study features a functional analysis of rationality, nudging, and boosting applied to public policy. The relationship between behavior and environmental variables is termed a “behavioral contingency,” and the analysis can include social and cultural phenomena by applying a selectionist perspective. Principles of behavioral control, whether tight or loose, may be exerted by policymakers or regulators who subscribe to paternalistic principles and may be met with demands of libertarianism among their recipients. This warrants discussion of the legitimacy and likelihood of behavioral control and influence on choices. Cases and examples are provided for extending the unit of analysis of choice behavior to achieve outcomes regulated by policies at the individual and group levels, including health, climate, and education. Further research and intervention comprise the study of macrocontingencies and metacontingencies. Advancing the understanding and application of behavioral science to policymaking may, therefore, benefit from moving from the relatively independent contributions of behavioral economics and behavior analysis to an inclusive selectionist approach for addressing choice behavior and cultural practices."
"Effectiveness and resource requirements of test, trace and isolate strategies for COVID in the UK","We use an individual-level transmission and contact simulation model to explore the effectiveness and resource requirements of various test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategies for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, in the context of different scenarios with varying levels of stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Based on modelling results, we show that self-isolation of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of their household contacts has a substantial impact on the number of new infections generated by each primary case. We further show that adding contact tracing of non-household contacts of confirmed cases to this broader package of interventions reduces the number of new infections otherwise generated by 5–15%. We also explore impact of key factors, such as tracing application adoption and testing delay, on overall effectiveness of TTI."
Frequency and patterns of exposure to live poultry and the potential risk of avian influenza transmission to humans in urban Bangladesh,"Avian influenza is endemic in Bangladesh, where greater than 90% of poultry are marketed through live poultry markets (LPMs). We conducted a population-based cross-sectional mobile telephone survey in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh to investigate the frequency and patterns of human exposure to live poultry in LPMs and at home. Among 1047 urban residents surveyed, 74.2% (95% CI 70.9–77.2) reported exposure to live poultry in the past year, with the majority of exposure occurring on a weekly basis. While visiting LPMs was less common amongst females (40.3%, 95% CI 35.0–45.8) than males (58.9%, 95% CI 54.0–63.5), females reported greater poultry exposure through food preparation, including defeathering (13.2%, 95% CI 9.5–17.9) and eviscerating (14.8%, 95% CI 11.2–19.4) (p < 0.001). A large proportion of the urban population is frequently exposed to live poultry in a setting where avian influenza viruses are endemic in LPMs. There is thus not only ample opportunity for spillover of avian influenza infections into humans in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but also greater potential for viral reassortment which could generate novel strains with pandemic potential."

"Social isolation, loneliness and mental health sequelae of the Covid-19 pandemic in Parkinson's disease","People living with Parkinson Disease (PwP) have been at risk for the negative effects of loneliness even before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite some similarities with previous outbreaks, the Covid-19 pandemic is significantly more wide-spread, long-lasting, and deadly, which likely means demonstrably more negative mental health issues. Although PwP are not any more likely to contract Covid-19 than those without, the indirect negative sequelae of isolation, loneliness, mental health issues, and worsening motor and non-motor features remains to be fully realized. Loneliness is not an isolated problem; the preliminary evidence indicates that loneliness associated with the Covid-19 restrictions has dramatically increased in nearly all countries around the world."
Delayed viral clearance despite high number of activated T cells during the acute phase in Argentinean patients with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome,"BACKGROUND: The hallmarks of HPS are increase of vascular permeability and endothelial dysfunction. Although an exacerbated immune response is thought to be implicated in pathogenesis, clear evidence is still elusive. As orthohantaviruses are not cytopathic CD8(+) T cells are believed to be the central players involved in pathogenesis. METHODS: Serum and blood samples from Argentinean HPS patients were collected from 2014 to 2019. Routine white blood cell analyses, quantification and characterization of T-cell phenotypic profile, viral load, neutralizing antibody response and quantification of inflammatory mediators were performed. FINDINGS: High numbers of activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were found in all HPS cases independently of disease severity. We found increased levels of some proinflammatory mediators during the acute phase of illness. Nonetheless, viral RNA remained high, showing a delay in clearance from blood up to late convalescence, when titers of neutralizing antibodies reached a high level. INTERPRETATION: The high activated phenotypic profile of T cells seems to be unable to resolve infection during the acute and early convalescent phases, and it was not associated with the severity of the disease. Thus, at least part of the activated T cells could be induced by the dysregulated inflammatory response in an unspecific manner. Viral clearance seems to have been more related to high titers of neutralizing antibodies than to the T-cell response. FUNDING: This work was supported mainly by the Administración Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud (ANLIS) “Dr. Carlos Malbrán”. Further details of fundings sources is included in the appendix."
Neighborhood Disadvantage and Children’s Cognitive Skill Trajectories,"This study examined how neighborhood poverty is associated with children’s trajectories of growth in math and reading skills in early elementary school, and how these associations vary by student characteristics, using multilevel growth models with nationally representative data from the 2011 Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort. About one-quarter (25.6%) of children lived in communities of concentrated poverty. Findings suggest that achievement gaps by neighborhood disadvantage are large and present before Kindergarten, shrink during the Kindergarten year, but then widen the year following, and remain relatively consistent in the first years of elementary school. Growth in math skills appeared to vary more with neighborhood poverty than growth in reading skills. There was limited evidence that the relationship between neighborhood poverty and test score trajectories varied by child race, ethnicity, early education and Kindergarten experience, and parents’ immigration status, but growth differences across student characteristics were small. Policy and research implications are discussed."

A Well-Structured Follow-Up Program is Required after Recovery from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); Release from Quarantine is Not the End of Treatment,"During the Coronavirus Infection Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of patients released from quarantine is exceeding the number of newly diagnosed cases. This study is a retrospective cohort study in which consultation data were collected from a COVID-19 follow-up health consultation program. The studied population was selected from patients who recovered after quarantine and treatment for COVID-19 in Daegu City and in Gyeongsangbukdo province, Korea, from March to June 2020. The healthcare providers comprised 20 family-medicine specialists who consulted and educated the patients through phone calls in accordance with structured guidelines. Physical and mental status before and after recovery were compared among patients who received a single consultation and those who received two or more consultations. A total of 1604 subjects were selected for the final analysis. Of these, 1145 (71.4%) had one consultation and 459 (28.6%) had two or more. The group that had two or more consultations reported significantly more physical symptoms, more psychological symptoms (including depression), and more psychological stress. Multivariate forward selection logistic regression analysis showed that re-confirmed cases of COVID-19, physical symptoms after quarantine, feelings of depression, and psychological stress had a significant effect on the number of consultations received. In conclusion, COVID-19 has various physical and mental sequelae after discharge from quarantine. Therefore, a well-structured follow-up program is needed after recovery."
Impact of Delta and Vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk: Lessons for Emerging Breakthrough infections,"With the continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and implementation of mass-scale interventions like vaccination, understanding factors affecting disease transmission has critical implications for control efforts. Here we used a simple adapted N95 mask sampling method to demonstrate the impact of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccination on 92 COVID-19 patients to expel virus into the air translating to a transmission risk. Between July and September 2021, when the Delta was the dominant circulating strain in Mumbai, we noted a two-fold increase in the proportion of people expelling virus (95%), about an eighty-fold increase in median viral load and a three-fold increase in high emitter type (41%; people expelling >1000 viral copy numbers in 30 minutes) compared to initial strains of 2020. Eight percent of these patients continued to be high emitters even after eight days of symptom onset, suggesting a probable increased transmission risk for Delta strain even at this stage. There was no significant difference in expelling pattern between partial, full and un-vaccinated individuals suggesting similar transmission risk. We noted significantly more infections among vaccinated study patients and their household members than unvaccinated, probably due to increased duration from vaccination and/or increased risk behaviour upon vaccination due to lower perceived threat. This study provides biological evidence for possible continued transmission of the Delta strain even with vaccination, emphasizing the need to continue COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The study also indicates that the mask method may be useful for screening future vaccine candidates, therapeutics or interventions for their ability to block transmission."
Applying critical systems thinking to social prescribing: a relational model of stakeholder “buy-in”,"BACKGROUND: Social prescribing (SP) allows health professionals to refer primary care patients toward health and wellbeing interventions and activities in the local community. Now widely implemented across the UK and adopted in other nations, questions arise concerning the modelling of present and future schemes, including challenges to full engagement encountered by stakeholders, which lie beyond the scope of traditional evaluations. Critical Systems Thinking (CST) allows for holistic analysis of fields where multiple stakeholders hold diverse interests and unequal power. METHODS: We use CST to (a) critically examine a developing rural social prescribing scheme from multiple stakeholder perspectives and (b) present a relational model for local social prescribing schemes. Our fieldwork included 24 in-depth interviews, regular planning meetings with key stakeholders, and discussions with those involved with national and international SP landscaping. A modified grounded theory approach was used for the analysis, and to consider the core elements of social prescribing sustainability. RESULTS: Our study confirms that local social prescribing schemes must operate with numerous stakeholder interests in mind, seeking to address real life social complexity and offer integrated solutions to multifaceted issues. Three main areas are discussed: holistic vision and boundary judgments; barriers and facilitators; relational issues and “emotional buy in”. Problems for staff include selecting suitable clients, feedback and technological issues and funding and evaluation pressures. Barriers for clients include health, transport and expense issues, also lack of prior information and GP involvement. Emotional “buy-in” emerged as essential for all stakeholders, but hard to sustain. Based on our findings we propose a positive relational model comprising shared vision, confidence and commitment; motivation and encouragement, support and wellbeing focus, collaborative relationships, communication and feedback, access to information /resources, learning in and from action, with emotional “buy-in” at its heart. CONCLUSION: Those implementing social prescribing in different localities inevitably face hard choices about what and whom to include. Research on the sustainability of social prescribing remains limited, studies are required to ascertain which “holistic” models of social prescribing work best for which communities, who are the main beneficiaries of these approaches and how “buy-in” is best sustained."
COVID-19 immune features revealed by a large-scale single-cell transcriptome atlas,
New solutions using natural products,"Most antibiotics are derived from natural products, like penicillin, as well as recent insecticides, like pyrethroids. Secondary metabolites are produced by plants as ecological chemical mediators, and can therefore possess intrinsic physiological properties against other organisms. These benefits are far from being fully explored. In particular, attention is here focused on the multipurpose neem tree (Azadirachta indica), reporting several experiments of applications in the field of seed oil and neem cake. The latter product seems to be promising because of the low cost, the possible production on a large scale, and the selection of effects in favor of beneficial organisms. Neem cake is able to act on different sites, as required by integrated pest management. Several utilizations of neem products are reported and their potentiality evidenced. Some considerations in this chapter may appear distant from the title of the book, but only by applying the general natural rules can the reason of the single phenomenon be understood. Other studies on resistance mechanisms of Plasmodium are enabling new possible methods of control always based on natural products activity."
"Influence of E-Liquid Humectants, Nicotine, and Flavorings on Aerosol Particle Size Distribution and Implications for Modeling Respiratory Deposition","Electronic cigarette, or vaping, products are used to heat an e-liquid to form an aerosol (liquid droplets suspended in gas) that the user inhales; a portion of this aerosol deposits in their respiratory tract and the remainder is exhaled, thereby potentially creating opportunity for secondhand exposure to bystanders (e.g., in homes, automobiles, and workplaces). Particle size, a critical factor in respiratory deposition (and therefore potential for secondhand exposure), could be influenced by e-liquid composition. Hence, the purposes of this study were to (1) test the influence of laboratory-prepared e-liquid composition [ratio of propylene glycol (PG) to vegetable glycerin (VG) humectants, nicotine, and flavorings] on particle size distribution and (2) model respiratory dosimetry. All e-liquids were aerosolized using a second-generation reference e-cigarette. We measured particle size distribution based on mass using a low-flow cascade impactor (LFCI) and size distribution based on number using real-time mobility sizers. Mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMADs) of aerosol from e-liquids that contained only humectants were significantly larger compared with e-liquids that contained flavorings or nicotine (p = 0.005). Humectant ratio significantly influenced MMADs; all aerosols from e-liquids prepared with 70:30 PG:VG were significantly larger compared with e-liquids prepared with 30:70 PG:VG (p = 0.017). In contrast to the LFCI approach, the high dilution and sampling flow rate of a fast mobility particle sizer strongly influenced particle size measurements (i.e., all calculated MMAD values were < 75 nm). Dosimetry modeling using LFCI data indicated that a portion of inhaled particles will deposit throughout the respiratory tract, though statistical differences in aerosol MMADs among e-liquid formulations did not translate into large differences in deposition estimates. A portion of inhaled aerosol will be exhaled and could be a source for secondhand exposure. Use of laboratory-prepared e-liquids and a reference e-cigarette to standardize aerosol generation and a LFCI to measure particle size distribution without dilution represents an improved method to characterize physical properties of volatile aerosol particles and permitted determination of MMAD values more representative of e-cigarette aerosol in situ, which in turn, can help to improve dose modeling for users and bystanders."
"Expression, purification and crystallization of the SARS-CoV macro domain","Macro domains or X domains are found as modules of multidomain proteins, but can also constitute a protein on their own. Recently, biochemical and structural studies of cellular macro domains have been performed, showing that they are active as ADP-ribose-1′′-phosphatases. Macro domains are also present in a number of positive-stranded RNA viruses, but their precise function in viral replication is still unknown. The major human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), one of which (nsp3) encompasses a macro domain. The SARS-CoV nsp3 gene region corresponding to amino acids 182–355 has been cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. The crystals belong to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 37.5, b = 55.6, c = 108.9 Å, β = 91.4°, and the asymmetric unit contains either two or three molecules. Both native and selenomethionine-labelled crystals diffract to 1.8 Å."
A new versatile modification of the Rayleigh distribution for modeling COVID-19 mortality rates,"The aim of this paper is to specify a new flexible statistical model to analyze COVID-19 mortality rates in Italy and Canada. A new versatile lifetime distribution with four parameters is proposed by using the exponentiated generalized class of distributions and the gull alpha power Rayleigh distribution to form the exponentiated generalized gull alpha power Rayleigh (EGGAPR) distribution. This new distribution is characterized by a tractable cumulative distribution function. To estimate the unknown parameters of the proposed distribution the maximum likelihood estimation method is used. In evaluating the effectiveness of the MLE method graphical displays of the Monte Carlo simulation are presented. The EGGAPR distribution is compared to its sub-models which include the exponentiated gull alpha Rayleigh distribution, the gull alpha Rayleigh distribution, exponentiated generalized Rayleigh distribution, exponentiated Rayleigh distribution and the Rayleigh distribution. Different measures of goodness-of-fit are used to investigate whether the EGGAPR distribution is more flexible and fit than its sub-models in modeling COVID-19 mortality rates."
"Retrospective Analysis of a Modified Organizational Model to Guarantee CT Workflow during the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Tertiary Hospital of Padova, Italy","At the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) outbreak in Italy, the cluster of Vò Euganeo was managed by the University Hospital of Padova. The Department of Diagnostic Imaging (DDI) conceived an organizational approach based on three different pathways for low-risk, high-risk, and confirmed Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) patients to accomplish three main targets: guarantee a safe pathway for non-COVID-19 patients, ensure health personnel safety, and maintain an efficient workload. Thus, an additional pathway was created with the aid of a trailer-mounted Computed Tomography (CT) scanner devoted to positive patients. We evaluated the performance of our approach from February 21 through April 12 in terms of workload (e.g., number of CT examinations) and safety (COVID-19-positive healthcare workers). There was an average of 72.2 and 17.8 COVID-19 patients per day in wards and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), respectively. A total of 176 high-risk and positive patients were examined. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) was one of the most common exams, and 24 pulmonary embolism scans were performed. No in-hospital transmission occurred in the DDI neither among patients nor among health personnel. The weekly number of in-patient CT examinations decreased by 27.4%, and the surgical procedures decreased by 29.5%. Patient screening and dedicated diagnostic pathways allowed the maintenance of high standards of care while working in safety."

"A contingent valuation approach to estimating the recreational value of commercial whale watching – the case study of Faxaflói Bay, Iceland","There is currently limited knowledge concerning the economic value of commercial whale watching from the perspective of the consumer's trip experience. This study outlines the results of an in-person contingent valuation survey, which asked whale watching tourists in Faxaflói Bay, Iceland, how much they would have been willing to pay beyond the paid ticket price. Based on a sample of 163 tourists, only 30 (18.40%) reported any consumer surplus, despite the majority stating positive satisfaction with the experience. Mean consumer surplus was 768 ISK (approximately 5.60 euros). Scaled up to the number of whale watching tourists in Faxaflói Bay in 2018 of 148,442, aggregate CS was approximately 114.0 million ISK (0.83 million euros), a 6.9% mark-up on estimated annual revenue generation derived from average ticket prices. The study provides new information on the economic value of whale watching in an area which had already been part-designated as a whale sanctuary."
Mechanisms of Cultural Evolution in the Songs of Wild Bird Populations,"Young songbirds draw the source material for their learned songs from parents, peers, and unrelated adults, as well as from innovation. These learned songs are used for intraspecific communication, and have well-documented roles for such functions as territory maintenance and mate attraction. The songs of wild populations differ, forming local “dialects” that may shift over time, suggesting that cultural evolution is at work. Recent work has focused on the mechanisms responsible for the cultural evolution of bird songs within a population, including drift, learning biases (such as conformity and rare-form copying), and selection (including sexual selection). In many songs or song repertoires, variability is partitioned, with some songs or song segments being stable and consistent, while others vary within the population and across time, and still others undergo population-wide transitions over time. This review explores the different mechanisms that shape the cultural evolution of songs in wild populations, with specific reference to a long-term investigation of a single population of philopatric Savannah sparrows. Males learn a single four-segment song during their 1st year and sing the same song thereafter. Within this song, the buzz segment is a population marker, and may be stable for decades – variant forms occur but eventually disappear. In contrast, the middle segment is highly variable both within the population and over time; changes in relative prevalence of different forms may be due to cultural drift or a rare-form learning bias. Within the introductory segment, a high note cluster was replaced by a click train between 1982 and 2010, following an S-shaped trajectory characteristic of both selective sweeps in population genetics and the replacement of one form by another in human language. In the case of the Savannah sparrows, this replacement may have been due to sexual selection. In subsequent generations, the number of clicks within trains increased, a form of cultural directional selection. In contrast to the narrowing of a trait's range during directional selection in genetic systems, variation in the number of clicks in a train increased as the mean value shifted because improvisation during song learning allowed the range of the trait to expand. Thus, in the single short song of the Savannah sparrow, at least four different mechanisms appear to contribute to three different types of cultural evolutionary outcomes. In the future, it will be import to explore the conditions that favor the application of specific (and perhaps conditional) learning rules, and studies such as the ongoing song seeding experiment in the Kent Island Savannah sparrow population will help in understanding the mechanisms that promote or repress changes in a population's song."

Gender Inequality and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: We explore gender differences in mental health deterioration and psychological well-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the mechanisms through which these differences may operate. Methods: Using data from the Life during Pandemic survey in Chile, which covers 2,545 adult respondents, we estimate econometric models to explore gender differences in psychological well-being and mental health as well as economic fragility and household workload during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: We find women are more likely to report overall bad mental health and deterioration of well-being. They are also more likely to have a new diagnosis of a mental health problem, to be pursuing treatment and taking prescription medication. Moreover, women report an increase in household chores and in childcare, and are more likely to have lost their employment or experienced a loss of income due to the pandemic. Conclusion: Our results offer a general picture of gender differences in the psychological impact of COVID-19. We argue that policies that mitigate economic stress and address the needs of women specifically may ease mental health deterioration due to the pandemic."
Anti‐obesity activity of Heracleum moellendorffii root extracts in 3T3‐L1 adipocytes,"It has been reported that H. mollendorffii roots (HMR) have various pharmacological activities such as anti‐inflammatory activity and immunostimulatory activity. However, the anti‐obesity activity of HMR has not been studied. Thus, we evaluated in vitro anti‐obesity of HMR in mouse preadipocytes, 3T3‐L1 cells. HMR reduced the lipid accumulation and triglyceride (TG) contents in 3T3‐L1 cells. HMR inhibited the protein expressions such as CCAAT/enhancer‐binding protein alpha (CEBPα), peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), perilipin‐1, adiponectin, fatty acid‐binding protein 4 (FABP4), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACC) related to the lipid accumulation of the mature adipocytes. In addition, HMR induced the proteasomal degradation of CEBPα related to the differentiation of the preadipocytes into the mature adipocytes by activating c‐Jun N‐terminal kinases (JNK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β). Based on the results of this study, HMR inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes through the CEBPα degradation via JNK and GSK3β activation and subsequently blocked lipid accumulation of mature adipocytes through inhibiting lipid accumulation‐related proteins such as CEBPα, PPARγ, perilipin‐1, adiponectin, FABP4, FAS, and ACC."
SARS-CoV-2 and the rheumatology patient: the last 12 months and a boost in the future,
Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant by sera from BNT162b2 or Coronavac vaccine recipients,"Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, designated as a Variant of Concern(VOC) by the World Health Organization, carries numerous spike protein mutations which have been found to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by COVID-19 vaccines. The susceptibility of Omicron variant by vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are urgently needed for risk assessment. Methods Omicron variant strains HKU691 and HKU344-R346K were isolated from patients using TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells. Whole genome sequence was determined using nanopore sequencing. Neutralization susceptibility of ancestral lineage A virus and the Omicron, Delta and Beta variants to sera from 25 BNT162b2 and 25 Coronavac vaccine recipients was determined using a live virus microneutralization assay. Results The Omicron variant strain HKU344-R346K has an additional spike R346K mutation, which is present in 8.5% of strains in GISAID database. Only 20% and 24% of BNT162b2 recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant HKU691 and HKU344-R346K, respectively, while none of the Coronavac recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody titer against either Omicron isolates. For BNT162b2 recipients, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titers(GMT) of the Omicron variant isolates(5.43 and 6.42) were 35.7-39.9-fold lower than that of the ancestral virus(229.4), and the GMT of both omicron isolates were significantly lower than those of the beta and delta variants. There was no significant difference in the GMT between HKU691 and HKU344-R346K. Conclusions Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by BNT162b2 or CoronaVac. The additional R346K mutation did not affect the neutralization susceptibility. Our data suggest that the Omicron variant may be associated with lower COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness."
Behavioral Intention to Receive a COVID-19 Vaccination Among Chinese Factory Workers: Cross-sectional Online Survey,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China soon. Understanding communities’ responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines is important. We applied the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with behavioral intention to receive self-financed or free COVID-19 vaccinations among Chinese factory workers who resumed work during the pandemic. We examined the effects of factors including sociodemographics, perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination, exposure to information about COVID-19 vaccination through social media, and COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by individuals and factories. METHODS: Participants were full-time employees 18 years or older who worked in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive a physical examination annually. Eligible workers attending six physical examination sites were invited to complete a survey on September 1-7, 2020. Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: The prevalence of behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was 66.6% (n=1368, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate) and 80.6% (n=1655, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and free vaccines). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25 and AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), perceived support from significant others for getting a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.55 and AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25-1.50), and perceived behavioral control to get a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73 and AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51) were positively associated with both dependent variables (conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate or free vaccines, respectively). Regarding social media influence, higher frequency of exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at market rate (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70) or a free vaccination (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.71). Higher self-reported compliance with wearing a face mask in the workplace (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58 and AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.27) and other public spaces (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42-2.29 and AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.77), hand hygiene (AOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.47 and AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.19-1.93), and avoiding social gatherings (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47 and AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.95) and crowded places (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51 and AOR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37-2.18) were also positively associated with both dependent variables. The number of COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by the factory was positively associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination under both scenarios (AOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12 and AOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Factory workers in China reported a high behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. The theory of planned behavior is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination."
Structural basis of a public antibody response to SARS-CoV-2,"Molecular-level understanding of human neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 could accelerate vaccine design and facilitate drug discovery. We analyzed 294 SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found that IGHV3–53 is the most frequently used IGHV gene for targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. We determined crystal structures of two IGHV3–53 neutralizing antibodies +/− Fab CR3022 ranging from 2.33 to 3.11 Å resolution. The germline-encoded residues of IGHV3–53 dominate binding to the ACE2 binding site epitope with no overlap with the CR3022 epitope. Moreover, IGHV3–53 is used in combination with a very short CDR H3 and different light chains. Overall, IGHV3–53 represents a versatile public VH in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, where their specific germline features and minimal affinity maturation provide important insights for vaccine design and assessing outcomes."

"COVID-19 and chronic disease patients: Perceived stress, worry, and emotional regulation strategies","OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed at investigating the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian individuals with a preexisting medical condition. Specifically, the study analyzed: (a) if different conditions were associated with different levels of distress, different levels of worry, and different emotion regulation strategies (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression); and (b) if distress levels were associated with levels of worry about COVID-19, emotion regulation strategies, and changes to medical treatment due to the pandemic. METHOD: This cross-sectional study involved 124 individuals (79.8% female; mean age = 48.88 years; SD = 14.95) with a diagnosis of chronic disease. The questionnaires, administered during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy (April-May 2020), comprised the Perceived Stress Scale, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, a COVID-19 worry questionnaire, and a questionnaire designed to collect anamnestic and sociodemographic data. RESULTS: Higher levels of expressive suppression and worries related to COVID-19, and changes to medical treatment due to the pandemic, were associated with higher perceived stress in patients with a preexisting chronic disease. No differences emerged in the study variables according to the type of chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of considering expressive suppression, levels of worry about COVID-19, and changes to scheduled medical treatment. Screening procedures based on these factors may be useful for identifying individuals with a preexisting medical condition at higher risk of distress, in order to offer them specific and remotely delivered psychological support.

"COVID-19 in the UK and Occupational Health and Safety: Predictable not Inevitable Failures by Government, and Trade Union and Nongovernmental Organization Responses","This commentary examines the occupational health and safety issues faced by the UK workers in the COVID-19 pandemic, against the background of government cuts in health care and in occupational health and safety budgets, and a deregulatory climate. The UK government has been obsessed, blinkered, and distracted by the desire to leave the European Union (Brexit). The state of knowledge about the virus, especially from international agencies that identified pandemic threats and strategies to combat it, is outlined. UK politicians, government bodies, medical and scientific advisors, and employers periodically ignored or abused that knowledge. Regulatory and ministerial inaction and errors on the workplace virus risks emerged. In contrast, several trade unions, health professional bodies, and nongovernmental organizations identified COVID-19 threats from poor personal protection equipment, working practices, and knowledge gaps and offered solutions for health care workers, social care workers, production workers, and service workers in “essential” occupations."
"Third Strain of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, United States",
Psychological Violence Against Arab Women in the Context of Social Media: Web-Based Questionnaire Study,"BACKGROUND: Social media provides women with varying platforms to express themselves, show their talents, communicate and expand their social relationships, and break the shackles imposed by their societies. Theoretically, social media can play a significant role in developing women’s freedom and decreasing social pressures; nonetheless, women continue to face violence during the social media era mainly in the form of psychological violence. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct an empirical in-depth analysis of how the digital space, particularly social media, provides men with new opportunities to surveil, restrict, harass, and intimidate feminists in Arab countries. METHODS: This study includes an empirical survey to investigate what Arab women think are the causes and types of violence wielded against them and their perspectives on the impact of that violence. This study used a web-based questionnaire administered through Google Forms (n=1312) with responses from Arab women aged 15 years and above from all Arab countries. RESULTS: We found that most Arab women feared posting an actual photograph of themselves on their social media accounts and only approximately one-third (490/1312, 37.3%) did so. Most women indicated that they encountered sexual harassment regardless of their age. Furthermore, most women were not aware of the legal aspects of this crime and even those who were aware indicated that they would not press charges for several reasons, including bringing dishonor upon their families, the time-consuming nature of litigation, and fear of revenge. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that young and less educated women are more vulnerable to abuse from either social media users or being condemned by their families. This has several effects, including lower self-esteem and hesitancy in seeking a job, feelings of mistrust and fear, cynicism, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. These issues hold women back from using social media in positive ways and some consider leaving social media."
Molecular docking between human TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: conformation and intermolecular interactions,"Entry of SARS-CoV-2, etiological agent of COVID-19, in the host cell is driven by the interaction of its spike protein with human ACE2 receptor and a serine protease, TMPRSS2. Although complex between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 has been structurally resolved, the molecular details of the SARS-CoV-2 and TMPRSS2 complex are still elusive. TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The present study aims to investigate the conformational attributes of the molecular complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike protein. Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different loops of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites. Key functional residues of TMPRSS2 (His296, Ser441 and Ser460) were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to the N-terminal cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686), TMPRSS2 region that interact with C-terminal cleavage site (Arg815/Ser816) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable. In summary, the present study provides structural characteristics of molecular complex between human TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing."
‘Not a good time’: Assessing the economic impact of COVID‐19 in Africa using a macro‐micro simulation approach,"The paper studies the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic on African economies and household welfare using a top‐down sequential macro‐micro simulation approach. The pandemic is modeled as a supply shock that disrupts economic activities of African countries and then affects households’ consumption behavior, the level of their welfare, and businesses’ investment decisions. The macroeconomic dynamic general equilibrium model is calibrated to account for informality, a key feature of African economies. We find that COVID‐19 could diminish employment in the formal and informal sectors and contract consumption of non‐savers and, especially, savers. These contractions would lead to an economic recession in Africa and widen both fiscal and current account deficits. Extreme poverty is expected to increase further in Africa, in particular if the welfare of the poorest households grows at lower rates. We also use the macroeconomic model to analyze the effects of different fiscal policy responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic."
Assessment of National Early Warning Score 2 as a Tool to Predict the Outcome of COVID-19 Patients on Admission,"Introduction: The ongoing pandemic due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put tremendous strain on the healthcare system around the world. There is a paucity of data describing the role of National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) in the assessment of COVID-19 cases. This study aimed at identifying NEWS2 calculated on admission as a valuable tool for risk stratification and prediction of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Materials and method: This prospective, observational study included 814 confirmed COVID-19 cases and was conducted over a period of three months. Vital parameters were assessed and NEWS2 was calculated on admission. Data were entered in excel format and statistical analysis was done in Python 3.8 statistical software (Wilmington, DE: Python Software Foundation). Pearson's chi-squared test was used following which a significant NEWS2 cut-off score to predict in-hospital mortality was determined by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Mortality of 9.09% was noted and correlations were made with age, comorbidity, and NEWS2 score. For in-hospital deaths, comorbidities were present in 66.21% of patients, the mean age was 60.14 years, and average NEWS2 score was 9. For discharged patients only 21.89% had comorbidities, mean age was 42.96 years, and average NEWS2 score was 1.17. NEWS2 score of ≥ 6 had a sensitivity of 93.24% and specificity of 98.91%, and hence was a statistically significant cut-off value for predicting mortality on admission. Conclusion:Age, presence of comorbidities, and NEWS2 have a positive correlation with mortality in COVID-19 patients. NEWS2 score being easy, reliable, and quick to calculate, should be used to triage these patients on admission. Scores ≥ 6 should be considered to have a higher risk of adverse outcomes and hence should be managed prudently along with clinical judgment."
Clinical evolution of antisynthetase syndrome after SARS-CoV2 infection: a 6-month follow-up analysis,
Optical Tracking of the Interfacial Dynamics of Single SARS-CoV-2 Pseudoviruses,"[Image: see text] The frequent detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in healthcare environments, accommodations, and wastewater has attracted great attention to the risk of viral transmission by environmental fomites. However, the process of SARS-CoV-2 adsorption to exposed surfaces in high-risk environments remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the interfacial dynamics of single SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with plasmonic imaging technology. Through the use of this technique, which has high spatial and temporal resolution, we tracked the collision of viruses at a surface and differentiated their stable adsorption and transient adsorption. We determined the effect of the electrostatic force on virus adhesion by correlating the solution and surface chemistry with the interfacial diffusion velocity and equilibrium position. Viral adsorption was found to be enhanced in real scenarios, such as in simulated saliva. This work not only describes a plasmonic imaging method to examine the interfacial dynamics of a single virus but also provides direct measurements of the factors that regulate the interfacial adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Such information is valuable for understanding virus transport and environmental transmission and even for designing anticontamination surfaces."

Effective Containment of a COVID-19 Subregional Outbreak in Italy Through Strict Quarantine and Rearrangement of Local Health Care Services,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the pandemic, the epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy has been characterized by the occurrence of subnational outbreaks. The World Health Organization recommended building the capacity to rapidly control COVID-19 clusters of cases in order to avoid the spread of the disease. This study describes a subregional outbreak of COVID-19 that occurred in the Emilia Romagna region, Italy, and the intervention undertaken to successfully control it. METHODS: Cases of COVID-19 were defined by a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on nasopharyngeal swab. The outbreak involved the residential area of a small town, with ~10 500 inhabitants in an area of 9 km(2). After the recognition of the outbreak, local health care authorities implemented strict quarantine and a rearrangement of health care services, consisting of closure of general practitioner outpatient clinics, telephone contact with all residents, activation of health care units to visit at-home patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and a dedicated Infectious Diseases ambulatory unit at the nearest hospital. RESULTS: The outbreak lasted from February 24 to April 6, 2020, involving at least 170 people with a cumulative incidence of 160 cases/10 000 inhabitants; overall, 448 inhabitants of the municipality underwent at least 1 nasopharyngeal swab to detect SARS-CoV-2 (positivity rate, 38%). Ninety-three people presented symptoms before March 11 (pre-intervention period), and 77 presented symptoms during the postintervention period (March 11–April 6). CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to control this COVID-19 outbreak by prompt recognition and implementation of a targeted local intervention."
“A Chain Only as Strong as Its Weakest Link”: An Up-to-Date Literature Review on the Bidirectional Interaction of Pulmonary Fibrosis and COVID-19,"[Image: see text] The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly became a worldwide healthcare emergency affecting millions of people, with poor outcomes for patients with chronic conditions and enormous pressure on healthcare systems. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) has been cited as a risk factor for a more severe evolution of COVID-19, primarily because its acute exacerbations are already associated with high mortality. We reviewed the available literature on biochemical, pathophysiological, and pharmacological mechanisms of PF and COVID-19 in an attempt to foresee the particular risk of infection and possible evolution of PF patients if infected with SARS-COV-2. We also analyzed the possible role of medication and risk factors (such as smoking) in the disease’s evolution and clinical course. We found out that there is a complexity of interactions between coexisting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial lung disease (ILD) and COVID-19 disease. Also, patients recovering from severe COVID-19 disease are at serious risk of developing PF. Smokers seem to have, in theory, a chance for a better outcome if they develop a severe form of COVID-19 but statistically are at much higher risk of dying if they become critically ill."

Isothermal Amplification and Ambient Visualization in a Single Tube for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Using Loop-Mediated Amplification and CRISPR Technology,"[Image: see text] We have developed a single-tube assay for SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples. This assay combined advantages of reverse transcription (RT) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) enzyme Cas12a. Our assay is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a single tube within 40 min, requiring only a single temperature control (62 °C). The RT-LAMP reagents were added to the sample vial, while CRISPR Cas12a reagents were deposited onto the lid of the vial. After a half-hour RT-LAMP amplification, the tube was inverted and flicked to mix the detection reagents with the amplicon. The sequence-specific recognition of the amplicon by the CRISPR guide RNA and Cas12a enzyme improved specificity. Visible green fluorescence generated by the CRISPR Cas12a system was recorded using a smartphone camera. Analysis of 100 human respiratory swab samples for the N and/or E gene of SARS-CoV-2 produced 100% clinical specificity and no false positive. Analysis of 50 samples that were detected positive using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulted in an overall clinical sensitivity of 94%. Importantly, this included 20 samples that required 30–39 threshold cycles of RT-qPCR to achieve a positive detection. Integration of the exponential amplification ability of RT-LAMP and the sequence-specific processing by the CRISPR-Cas system into a molecular assay resulted in improvements in both analytical sensitivity and specificity. The single-tube assay is beneficial for future point-of-care applications."
High-dimensional single-cell analysis reveals the immune characteristics of COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), driven by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes are regarded as the central drivers of the cytokine storm associated with the severity of COVID-19. In this study, we explored the characteristic peripheral cellular profiles of patients with COVID-19 in both acute and convalescent phases by single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). Using a combination of algorithm-guided data analyses, we identified peripheral immune cell subsets in COVID-19 and revealed CD4(+) T-cell depletion, T-cell differentiation, plasma cell expansion, and the reduced antigen presentation capacity of innate immunity. Notably, COVID-19 induces a dysregulation in the balance of monocyte populations by the expansion of the monocyte subsets. Collectively, our results represent a high-dimensional, single-cell profile of the peripheral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection."
Comprehensive Deep Mutational Scanning Reveals the Immune-Escaping Hotspots of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain Targeting Neutralizing Antibodies,"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has caused the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the collapse of medical care systems and economic depression worldwide. To combat COVID-19, neutralizing antibodies have been investigated and developed. However, the evolutions (mutations) of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 enable escape from neutralization by these antibodies, further impairing recognition by the human immune system. Thus, it is critical to investigate and predict the putative mutations of RBD that escape neutralizing immune responses. Here, we employed computational analyses to comprehensively investigate the mutational effects of RBD on binding to neutralizing antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and demonstrated that the RBD residues K417, L452, L455, F456, E484, G485, F486, F490, Q493, and S494 were consistent with clinically emerging variants or experimental observations of attenuated neutralizations. We also revealed common hotspots, Y449, L455, and Y489, that exerted comparable destabilizing effects on binding to both ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies. Our results provide valuable information on the putative effects of RBD variants on interactions with neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide insights into possible evolutionary hotspots that can escape recognition by these antibodies. In addition, our study results will benefit the development and design of vaccines and antibodies to combat the newly emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2."
E-Learning During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Surge in Childhood Obesity,"The coronavirus pandemic protracted disruption of in-person schooling, sports and other activities leading to obesity that could have long-lasting impact on children’s health. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of E-learning. Children are snacking more, exercising less. Their increased screen time, sedentary life style and inadequate sleep anticipated weight gain during Lockdown that could lead to complications. To study the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on increased weight gain in children. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to May 2021 at tertiary care hospital, Thandalam among 2000 children between the age of 3–15 years on weight gain during COVID-19 Lockdown. A questionnaire requesting demographic and Anthropometric details was circulated. BMI percentiles were calculated, totalled and compared between pre-school closing and school closing period. Paired t-test was done. p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Out of 2000 children, 308 were excluded. Male preponderance was noted. Age range was between 3 and 15 years with mean age being 8.5 years. Study revealed significant differences in variables such as body weight, body mass index before and after lockdown. Post-lockdown, the mean body mass index (BMI) increased among all participants from 17.32 to 17.80 kg/m(2) (p < 0.001). Obesity definitely has a proportional impact on the children’s Quality of Life (QOL). It is important to address childhood obesity, which if neglected may lead to long-term profound complications of higher eminence than the actual COVID-19 infection. The prevention and management of childhood obesity should be set as a priority at an individual, community and population level during this pandemic."

The therapeutic potential of apelin in kidney disease,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality and is independently associated with cardiovascular disease. The mainstay of treatment for CKD is blockade of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), which reduces blood pressure and proteinuria and slows kidney function decline. Despite this treatment, many patients progress to kidney failure, which requires dialysis or kidney transplantation, and/or die as a result of cardiovascular disease. The apelin system is an endogenous physiological regulator that is emerging as a potential therapeutic target for many diseases. This system comprises the apelin receptor and its two families of endogenous ligands, apelin and elabela/toddler. Preclinical and clinical studies show that apelin receptor ligands are endothelium-dependent vasodilators and potent inotropes, and the apelin system has a reciprocal relationship with the RAAS. In preclinical studies, apelin regulates glomerular haemodynamics and acts on the tubule to promote aquaresis. In addition, apelin is protective in several kidney injury models. Although the apelin system has not yet been studied in patients with CKD, the available data suggest that apelin is a promising potential therapeutic target for kidney disease."

Salient Conclusive Remarks on Epidemiology and Clinical Manifestations of Pediatric COVID-19: Narrative Review,"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), constituted significant public health concerns and impacted the human populations with massive economic and social burdens worldwide. The disease is known to infect people of all ages, including children, adults, and the elderly. Although several reports about pediatric COVID-19 were seen in the literature, we believe that the epidemiology and pathology of the infection described in these reports are not conclusive. Therefore, in this scientific communication, a narrative review study was performed to shed some light on the characteristic epidemiological features and clinical phenotypes of pediatric COVID-19. In this report, we had compiled and presented the different epidemiological features of the disease related to the age of infection, virus acquisition, explanations of the low infectivity rates, and consequences of infections. The discriminatory clinical manifestations of the disease in children were also addressed and discussed in this review. The search included the data published from the date of the start of the pandemic in December 2019 up to October 2020. Our literature search revealed that children of all ages, including neonates, had been infected by the virus. Despite the fact that pediatric COVID-19 is less common to occur, as compared to the disease in adults, the infected children usually manifest the disease symptomatology in benign form. Asymptomatic and symptomatic adult patients are the primary source of the virus to the children. Intrauterine transmission of the virus and breastfeeding infections to the neonates were hypothesized in some studies but ruled out since they were not confirmed. Intensive review and discussion warranting the low infection rates and benign conditions of COVID-19 in children were also made in this study. As documented in many studies, the infectivity, morbidity, and mortality rates of the disease among the children populations are much lower than those in adults. They also seem to be lower than those observed during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics. The described clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 in children do not differ much from those of adults, and complications of the disease seem to be associated with comorbidities."
In-silico design of a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 S protein,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a pandemic and is public health emergency of international concern. As of now, no registered therapies are available for treatment of coronavirus infection. The viral infection depends on the attachment of spike (S) glycoprotein to human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have designed a protein inhibitor (ΔABP-D25Y) targeting S protein using computational approach. The inhibitor consists of two α helical peptides homologues to protease domain (PD) of ACE2. Docking studies and molecular dynamic simulation revealed that the inhibitor binds exclusively at the ACE2 binding site of S protein. The computed binding affinity of the inhibitor is higher than the ACE2 and thus will likely out compete ACE2 for binding to S protein. Hence, the proposed inhibitor ΔABP-D25Y could be a potential blocker of S protein and receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment."
"Comparison of the Characteristics, Management, and Outcomes of STEMI Patients Presenting With vs. Those of Patients Presenting Without COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the differences in the characteristics, management, and clinical outcomes of patients with and that of those without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection who had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). METHODS: Databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched up to July 2021. Observational studies that reported on the characteristics, management, or clinical outcomes and those published as full-text articles were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of all included studies. RESULTS: A total of 27,742 patients from 13 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Significant delay in symptom onset to first medical contact (SO-to-FMC) time (mean difference = 23.42 min; 95% CI: 5.85–40.99 min; p = 0.009) and door-to-balloon (D2B) time (mean difference = 12.27 min; 95% CI: 5.77–18.78 min; p = 0.0002) was observed in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 negative patients, those who are positive patients had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and thrombus grade (p < 0.05) and showed more frequent use of thrombus aspiration and glycoprotein IIbIIIa (Gp2b3a) inhibitor (p < 0.05). COVID-19 positive patients also had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (OR = 5.98, 95% CI: 4.78–7.48, p < 0.0001), cardiogenic shock (OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 2.02–3.76, p < 0.0001), and stent thrombosis (OR = 5.65, 95% CI: 2.41–13.23, p < 0.0001). They were also more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR = 4.26, 95% CI: 2.51–7.22, p < 0.0001) and had a longer length of stay (mean difference = 4.63 days; 95% CI: 2.56–6.69 days; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that COVID-19 infection had an impact on the time of initial medical intervention for patients with STEMI after symptom onset and showed that COVID-19 patients with STEMI were more likely to have thrombosis and had poorer outcomes."

Islet Biology during COVID-19: Progress and Perspectives,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had significant impact on research directions and productivity in the past year. Despite these challenges, since 2020, >2,500 peer-reviewed articles in pancreatic islet biology have been published. These include updates on the roles of isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and incretin hormones in insulin secretion, as well as the discovery of Inceptor and signaling by circulating RNAs. 2020 also brought advancements in in vivo and in vitro models, including a new transgenic mouse for assessing β-cell proliferation, a pancreas-on-a-chip to study glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and successful genetic editing of primary human islet cells. Islet biologists evaluated the functionality of stem cell-derived islet-like cells coated with semi-permeable biomaterials to prevent autoimmune attack, revealing the importance of cell maturation following transplantation. Prompted by observations that COVID-19 symptoms can worsen for people with obesity or diabetes, researchers examined how islets are directly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, we highlight novel functional insights, technologies and therapeutic approaches emerging between March 2020 and July 2021, written for both scientific and lay audiences. We also include a response to these advancements from patient stakeholders, to help lend broader perspective to developments and challenges in islet research."

Deficits in planned hospital care for vulnerable adolescents in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: analysis of linked administrative data,"Planned hospital care (outpatient attendances and planned hospital admissions) was disrupted during the pandemic, but we lack evidence on which groups of young people were most impacted. We aimed to describe differences in planned care for vulnerable adolescents receiving children's social care (CSC) services or special educational needs (SEN) support during the pandemic, relative to their peers. Using the ECHILD Database (linked de-identified administrative health, education and social care records for all children in England), we examined changes in planned hospital care from 23 March to 31 December 2020 for secondary school pupils in Years 7 to 11 (N=3,030,235). There were large deficits in planned care for adolescents overall, which disproportionately affected the 21% receiving SEN support or CSC services who bore 25% of the outpatient attendance deficit and 37% of the planned admissions deficit. These findings indicate a need for targeted catch-up funding and resources, particularly for vulnerable groups."
CRDB: A Centralized Cancer Research DataBase and an example use case mining correlation statistics of cancer and covid-19,"BACKGROUND: The advancement of cancer research has been facilitated through freely available cancer literature, databases and tools. The age of genomics and big data has given rise to the need for cooperation and data sharing in order to make efficient use of this new information in the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there are many databases for cancer research their access is not easy due to different ways of processing and managing the data. There is absence of a unified platform to manage all of them in a transparent and more comprehensible way. OBJECTIVE: In the herein research effort, an improved integrated cancer research database and platform is provided facilitating a deeper statistical insight of correlation between cancer and COVID-19 pandemic, unifying the collection of almost all previous published cancer databases and defining a model web database for cancer research, scoring databases on the basis of the variety types of cancer, sample size, completeness of omics results, and user interface. METHODS: Databases examined and integrated include Data Portal database, Genomic database, Proteomic database, Expression database, Gene database and Mutation database; and it is expected that this launch will sort, save, advance understanding and encourage the use of these resources in the cancer research environment. RESULTS: To make it easy to search valuable information 85 cancer databases are provided in the form of table as well as the database of databases named Cancer research database (CRDB) has been built and herein presented. Furthermore, the CRDB has been herein equipped with unique navigation tools so that to be explored by three methods, i.e., any single database can be browsed by typing the name in the given search bar, while all Categories can be browsed by clicking on the name of the category, or image expression icon, a facility that could provide all the categories databases on a single click. CONCLUSIONS: Moreover, the computational platform (PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL) is used to build CRDB for the cancer scientific community, which can be freely investigated and browsed by clicking at https://www.habdsk.org/crdb.php, and is planned to be updated timely. In addition, based on the proposed platform, the status and diagnoses statistics of cancer during COVID-19 pandemic has been herein thoroughly investigated through using CRDB, thus, providing an easy to manage and understandable framework that mining knowledge for future researchers."
COVID-19: The experience from Italy,"A wide range of cutaneous signs are atributed to COVID-19 infection. This retrospective study assessed the presence and impact of dermatologic manifestations related to COVID-19 spread in Lombardy, the geographic district with the most important outbreak in Italy. A cohort of 345 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was collected from February 1 to May 31, 2020. Cutaneous signs and dermatologic diagnosis were recorded on admission and during the course of the disease. Of the 345 patients included in the study, 52 (15%) had new-onset dermatologic conditions related to COVID-19. We observed 7 major cutaneous clinical patterns, merged under 3 main groups: exanthems, vascular lesions. and other cutaneous manifestations. Each subset was detailed with prevalence, age, duration, prognosis and histology. Cutaneous findings can lead to suspect COVID-19 infection and identify potentially contagious cases with indolent course."

Computational Model Reveals a Stochastic Mechanism behind Germinal Center Clonal Bursts,"Germinal centers (GCs) are specialized compartments within the secondary lymphoid organs where B cells proliferate, differentiate, and mutate their antibody genes in response to the presence of foreign antigens. Through the GC lifespan, interclonal competition between B cells leads to increased affinity of the B cell receptors for antigens accompanied by a loss of clonal diversity, although the mechanisms underlying clonal dynamics are not completely understood. We present here a multi-scale quantitative model of the GC reaction that integrates an intracellular component, accounting for the genetic events that shape B cell differentiation, and an extracellular stochastic component, which accounts for the random cellular interactions within the GC. In addition, B cell receptors are represented as sequences of nucleotides that mature and diversify through somatic hypermutations. We exploit extensive experimental characterizations of the GC dynamics to parameterize our model, and visualize affinity maturation by means of evolutionary phylogenetic trees. Our explicit modeling of B cell maturation enables us to characterise the evolutionary processes and competition at the heart of the GC dynamics, and explains the emergence of clonal dominance as a result of initially small stochastic advantages in the affinity to antigen. Interestingly, a subset of the GC undergoes massive expansion of higher-affinity B cell variants (clonal bursts), leading to a loss of clonal diversity at a significantly faster rate than in GCs that do not exhibit clonal dominance. Our work contributes towards an in silico vaccine design, and has implications for the better understanding of the mechanisms underlying autoimmune disease and GC-derived lymphomas."
Teachers’ emotional well-being during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with long school closures: A large-scale cross-sectional survey in Northern Italy,"Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the magnitude of emotional burden on teaching staff during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a significantly impacted region. In addition, the correlates of emotional burden were analysed to enable the design of targeted interventions. Study design Cross-sectional survey. Methods An electronic survey was administered to the teaching staff at public schools and kindergartens in a specific geographical area. Cross-sectional assessments of pandemic-specific variables were performed using the Pandemic Fatigue Scale (PFS), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-21, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). DASS-21 results were compared with results from a parallel survey that was representative of the local general population. Results In total, 3251 teaching staff members participated in the survey. Teachers showed a higher emotional burden for depression, anxiety and stress than the general population during the pandemic. According to a linear regression model, this burden is correlated with the language in which the questionnaires where answered, mistrust towards institutions, specific SARS-CoV-2 anxiety, past infection with SARS-CoV-2, avoidance of information about the pandemic and pandemic fatigue; emotional burden was negatively correlated with measures for life satisfaction, resilience and team atmosphere. Some independent variables were shown to contribute differentially to the variance of depression, anxiety or stress. Conclusions Emotional distress during the pandemic among teachers is higher than the general population and correlates with variables that could, at least in principle, be targeted for specific interventions."
Cardiac involvement in Behçet disease presenting as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis: A case report,"Behçet disease (BD) is a form of widespread vasculitis that involves both arteries and veins. Cardiac involvement in BD is exceedingly rare and can present as a form of non-bacterial- thrombotic-endocarditis (NBTE). A 54-year-old man with Behçet disease was admitted to our hospital after presenting with abdominal pain and fever. He had been recently discharged from a hospital in another country with the diagnosis of infective endocarditis of the mitral valve and mycotic embolization to the superior mesenteric artery. At presentation, oral and genital ulcers were present, raising the suspicion of a flare of BD. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a small vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Blood cultures results were negative. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed extensive inferior vena cava thrombosis. The aneurysm and thrombotic phenomena were interpreted as related to BD: the vegetation on the mitral valve was diagnosed as NBTE of which BD is a recognized cause. With corticosteroid and anticoagulant therapy, the patient's symptoms steadily improved. NBTE is a rare manifestation of BD; differential diagnosis with infective endocarditis can be challenging and should be focused on identifying predisposing conditions. The mainstay of treatment in NBTE is medical therapy with anticoagulation and treatment of the underlying disease. <Learning objective: Cardiac involvement in the setting of Behçet Disease (BD) is rare and several different manifestations are described (intracardiac thrombus, non-infective endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, endomyocardial fibrosis, coronary arteritis). Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is also a rare finding which can happen in the setting of BD. Its prevalence is unknown and evidence is derived only from scarce case reports.The role of BD as a potential cause of NBTE must be acknowledged to avoid potential misdiagnosis.>."
Dexamethasone-loaded ROS-responsive poly(thioketal) nanoparticles suppress inflammation and oxidative stress of acute lung injury,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with excessive inflammatory response, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) without timely treatment. A fewer effective drugs are available currently to treat the ALI/ARDS. Herein, a therapeutic nanoplatform with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsiveness was developed for the regulation of inflammation. Dexamethasone acetate (Dex) was encapsulated into poly(thioketal) polymers to form polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) (PTKNPs@Dex). The NPs were composed of poly(1,4-phenyleneacetonedimethylene thioketal) (PPADT) and polythioketal urethane (PTKU), in which the thioketal bonds could be cleaved by the high level of ROS at the ALI site. The PTKNPs@Dex could accumulate in the pulmonary inflammatory sites and release the encapsulated payloads rapidly, leading to the decreased ROS level, less generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced lung injury and mortality of mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that the therapeutic efficacy of the NPs was associated with the modulation of many immune and inflammation-linked pathways. These findings provide a newly developed nanoplatform for the efficient treatment of ALI/ARDS."
Therapeutic potential of ginger against COVID-19: Is there enough evidence?,"In addition to the respiratory system, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strikes other systems, including the digestive, circulatory, urogenital, and even the central nervous system, as its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in various organs, such as lungs, intestine, heart, esophagus, kidneys, bladder, testis, liver, and brain. Different mechanisms, in particular, massive virus replication, extensive apoptosis and necrosis of the lung-related epithelial and endothelial cells, vascular leakage, hyper-inflammatory responses, overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators, cytokine storm, oxidative stress, downregulation of ACE2, and impairment of the renin-angiotensin system contribute to the COVID-19 pathogenesis. Currently, COVID-19 is a global pandemic with no specific anti-viral treatment. The favorable capabilities of the ginger were indicated in patients suffering from osteoarthritis, neurodegenerative disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, respiratory distress, liver diseases and primary dysmenorrheal. Ginger or its compounds exhibited strong anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative influences in numerous animal models. This review provides evidence regarding the potential effects of ginger against SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and immunomodulatory impacts in an attempt to consider this plant as an alternative therapeutic agent for COVID-19 treatment."
Public health concerns of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 endemicity in Africa,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 was first officially reported in Africa in 2006; thereafter this virus has spread rapidly from Nigeria to 11 other African countries. This study was aimed at utilizing data from confirmed laboratory reports to carry out a qualitative evaluation of the factors responsible for HPAI H5N1 persistence in Africa and the public health implications; and to suggest appropriate control measures. Relevant publications were sought from data banks and repositories of FAO, OIE, WHO, and Google scholars. Substantiated data on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in Africa and in humans across the world were mined. HPAI H5N1 affects poultry and human populations, with Egypt having highest human cases (346) globally. Nigeria had a reinfection from 2014 to 2015, with outbreaks in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso throughout 2016 unabated. The persistence of this virus in Africa is attributed to the survivability of HPAIV, ability to evolve other subtypes through genetic reassortment, poor biosecurity compliance at the live bird markets and poultry farms, husbandry methods and multispecies livestock farming, poultry vaccinations, and continuous shedding of HPAIV, transboundary transmission of HPAIV through poultry trades; and transcontinental migratory birds. There is, therefore, the need for African nations to realistically reassess their status, through regular surveillance and be transparent with HPAI H5N1 outbreak data. Also, it is important to have an understanding of HPAIV migration dynamics which will be helpful in epidemiological modeling, disease prevention, control and eradication measures."
A Case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Presenting with Seizures Secondary to Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. COVID-19-associated thrombotic events are recognized. A wide variety of neurological presentations have been recently documented. We report the first case of COVID-19 presenting with generalized seizure secondary to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
Target Capture Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes Using the ONETest Coronaviruses Plus,"Background Genomic sequencing is important to track and monitor genetic changes in SARS-CoV-2. We introduce a target capture next-generation sequencing methodology, the ONETest Coronaviruses Plus, to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes and select genes of other respiratory viruses simultaneously. Methods We applied the ONETest on 70 respiratory samples (collected in Florida, USA between May and July, 2020), in which SARS-CoV-2 had been detected by a qualitative PCR assay. For 48 (69%) of the samples, we also applied the ARTIC protocol for Illumina sequencing. All the libraries were sequenced as 2×150 nucleotide reads on an Illumina instrument. The ONETest data were analyzed using an in-house pipeline and the ARTIC data using a published pipeline to produce consensus SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, to which lineages were assigned using pangolin. Results Of the 70 ONETest libraries, 45 (64%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence (> 29,000 bases and with > 90% of its bases covered by at least 10 reads). Of the 48 ARTIC libraries, 25 (52%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. In 24 out of 34 (71%) samples in which both the ONETest and ARTIC sequences were complete or near-complete and in which lineage could be assigned to both the ONETest and ARTIC sequences, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage identified was the same. Conclusions The ONETest can be used to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in archived samples and thereby enable detection of circulating and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Target capture approaches, such as the ONETest, are less prone to loss of sequence coverage probably due to amplicon dropouts encountered in amplicon approaches, such as ARTIC. With its added value of characterizing other major respiratory pathogens, although not assessed in this study, the ONETest can help to better understand the epidemiology of infectious respiratory disease in the post COVID-19 era."

Gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To summarise the published evidence on the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 in children and to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and the WHO’s database of publications on novel coronavirus. We included English language studies that had described original demographic and clinical characteristics of children diagnosed with COVID-19 and reported on the presence or absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effects model. The pooled prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms was expressed as proportion and 95% CI. RESULTS: The search identified 269 citations. Thirteen studies (nine case series and four case reports) comprising data for 284 patients were included. Overall, we rated four studies as having a low risk of bias, eight studies as moderate and one study as high risk of bias. In a meta-analysis of nine studies, comprising 280 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 22.8% (95% CI 13.1% to 35.2%; I(2)=54%). Diarrhoea was the most commonly reported gastrointestinal symptom followed by vomiting and abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly a quarter of children with COVID-19 have gastrointestinal symptoms. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the gastrointestinal manifestation of COVID-19. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020177569."

State-of-the-art methods for studying air distributions in commercial airliner cabins,"Air distributions in commercial airliner cabins are crucial for creating a thermally comfortable and healthy cabin environment. This paper reviews the methods used in predicting, designing, and analyzing air distributions in the cabins, among which experimental measurements and numerical simulations are the two popular ones. The experimental measurements have usually been seen as more reliable although they are more expensive and time consuming. Most of the numerical simulations use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that can provide effectively detailed information. Numerous applications using the two methods can be found in the literature for studying air distributions in aircraft cabins, including investigations on more reliable and accurate models. The review in the paper shows that the studies using both experimental measurements and computer simulations are becoming popular. And it is necessary to use a full-scale test rig to obtain reliable and high quality experimental data. What’s more, the hybrid CFD models are found to be rather promising for simulating air distributions in airliner cabins."
An international comparison of the second derivative of COVID-19 deaths after implementation of social distancing measures,"This work compares deaths for confirmed COVID-19 cases in China to eight other countries, Italy, Spain, France, USA, UK, Germany, Netherlands and South Korea. After implementing varying intensities and timing of social distancing measures, several appear to be converging onto the decline in the daily growth rate of deaths, or relative second derivative of total deaths, seen in China after the implementation an aggressive social distancing policy. By calculating future trajectories in these countries based on the observed Chinese fatality statistics, an estimate of the total deaths and maximum daily death rates over a defined period of time is made. Our lower bound estimate for the United Kingdom based on the real data approximates the lower bound estimate of the recent modelling study of Ferguson et al. [1]. These results suggest there may be a threshold of effective public health intervention. Our method of viewing the data may be helpful in monitoring the course of the epidemic, judging the effectiveness of implementation, and monitoring the relaxation of social distancing."

A Mobile Health Platform for Self-Management of Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis: Qualitative Study of Adaptation to Stakeholder Needs and Integration in Clinical Settings,"BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited chronic condition that requires extensive daily care and quarterly clinic visits with a multidisciplinary care team. The limited exchange of information outside of the quarterly clinic visits impedes optimal disease self-management, patient engagement, and shared decision making. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to adapt a mobile health (mHealth) app originally developed in Sweden to the needs of patients, families, and health care providers in a CF center in the United States and to test it as a platform for sharing patient-generated health data with the CF health care team. METHODS: Focus groups with health care providers of patients with CF, adolescents with CF, and caregivers of children with CF were conducted to determine what modifications were necessary. Focus group data were analyzed using a thematic analysis, and emergent themes were ranked according to desirability and technical feasibility. The mHealth platform was then modified to meet the identified needs and preferences, and the flow of patient-generated health data to a secure Research Electronic Data Capture database was tested. Protocols for data management and clinical follow-up were also developed. RESULTS: A total of 5 focus groups with 21 participants were conducted. Recommended modifications pertained to all functionalities of the mHealth platform, including tracking of symptoms, treatments, and activities of daily care; creating and organizing medication lists and setting up reminders; generating reports for the health care team; language and presentation; sharing and privacy; and settings and accounts. Overall, health care providers recommended changes to align the mHealth platform with US standards of care, people with CF and their caregivers requested more tracking functionalities, and both groups suggested the inclusion of a mental health tracker as well as more detailed response options and precise language. Beta testers of the modified platform reported issues related to translatability to US environment and various bugs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the importance of identifying the needs and preferences of target users and stakeholders before adopting existing mHealth solutions. All relevant perspectives, including those of clinicians, patients, and caregivers, should be thoroughly considered to meet both end users’ needs and evidence-based practice recommendations."
Iran’s success in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic,
Repurposing potential of posaconazole and grazoprevir as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase,"As the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic engulfs millions worldwide, the quest for vaccines or drugs against the virus continues. The helicase protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents an attractive target for drug discovery since inhibition of helicase activity can suppress viral replication. Using in silico approaches, we have identified drugs that interact with SARS-CoV-2 helicase based on the presence of amino acid arrangements matching binding sites of drugs in previously annotated protein structures. The drugs exhibiting an RMSD of ≤ 3.0 Å were further analyzed using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and post-MD analyses. Using these approaches, we found 12 drugs that showed strong interactions with SARS-CoV-2 helicase amino acids. The analyses were performed using the recently available SARS-CoV-2 helicase structure (PDB ID: 5RL6). Based on the MM-GBSA approach, out of the 12 drugs, two drugs, namely posaconazole and grazoprevir, showed the most favorable binding energy, − 54.8 and − 49.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, of the amino acids found conserved among all human coronaviruses, 10/11 and 10/12 were targeted by, respectively, grazoprevir and posaconazole. These residues are part of the crucial DEAD-like helicase C and DEXXQc_Upf1-like/ DEAD-like helicase domains. Strong interactions of posaconazole and grazoprevir with conserved amino acids indicate that the drugs can be potent against SARS-CoV-2. Since the amino acids are conserved among the human coronaviruses, the virus is unlikely to develop resistance mutations against these drugs. Since these drugs are already in use, they may be immediately repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 therapy."

Dissocial Personality Traits and Past Experiences Matter in How People Perceive the Police,"The study investigated the contributions of dissocial traits and experience with the police to police perception. Participants (261: males = 115, females = 146, mean age = 25.87) completed psychometric measures deviant personality traits, police perception, and experience with the police. Regression analysis was used to examine relationship patterns. Results indicated that people detested the police as they got older (β = − 0.19, t = − 2.06, p = 0.04). Also, having an encounter was associated with more negative perception of the (β = − 0.16, t = − 1.97, p = 0.04). Among the dark triad traits, only narcissism predicted police perception such that higher narcissism traits was associated with higher negative perception of the police (β = − 0.46, t = − 2.21, p = 0.03). Findings seem to suggest that the police, especially in Nigeria, needs to do more to improve their connections with citizens; albeit, individual personality disposition matters, and should be a potential issue to consider when the police deals with citizens."
COVID-19: A Source of Stress and Depression Among University Students and Poor Academic Performance,"Current research examines how COVID-19 has impacted the daily life of students, specifically personal and academic aspects. The authors investigated the role of academic and family stress caused by COVID-19 on students' depression levels and the subsequent impact on their academic performance based on Lazarus' cognitive appraisal theory of stress. The non-probability convenience sampling technique has been used to collect data from undergraduate and postgraduate students using a modified questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale. This study used structural equation modeling to examine the link between stress, depression, and academic performance during COVID-19. It was confirmed that educational and family stress significantly leads to depression among students, negatively affecting their academic performance and learning outcomes. This research provides valuable information to parents, educators, and other stakeholders concerned about their children's education and performance."
International Microsurgery Club Webinar Series-Bridging the Knowledge Gap during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"PURPOSE: The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak shut down most conferences. To minimalize the influence, virtual meetings sprang up subsequently. International Microsurgery Club (IMC), as one of the largest professionals-only online microsurgery education groups worldwide, began to host regular weekend webinars during the pandemic to fill the knowledge gap. This study aims to discuss how webinars have fundamentally changed the way knowledge is delivered and exchanged. METHODS: From February 29, 2020 to March 14, 2021, 103 IMC webinars were reviewed and analyzed in detail to determine the use, benefit, and effect. A comparison between webinars hosted by the different societies was made as well. A questionnaire survey focusing on attendees' behavior, attitude, and using habit about webinars was also made. RESULTS: As for the 103 IMC webinar events, the peak participants were 112.3 people in average. The members requesting to join IMC abruptly increased during the pandemic, and the group activity increased dramatically. From the questionnaire (n = 68), the satisfaction level was high (8.88 ± 1.18/10). The respondents were most satisfied with the good quality of the speakers (73.5%). Not only hosts our webinar series but IMC also serves as the platform that welcomes webinars from other societies to share their information. In September 2020, International Microsurgery Webinar League was established via the significant webinar hosts, with more than 300 recorded webinar talks connected successfully. CONCLUSION: As the knowledge revolution driven by COVID-19 will continue, IMC will keep playing an essential role in exploring new and emerging opportunities to improve knowledge dissemination worldwide beyond the space-time boundary."
Contraception in the COVID-19 pandemic: recommendations from the Korean society of contraception and reproductive health,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a systemic inflammatory response that activates coagulation in symptomatic patients. In addition, a rare form of thrombosis has been reported in people who received the COVID-19 vaccine, most of whom were women younger than 50 years of age. Considering that hormonal contraceptive methods widely used by women of childbearing age increase the risk of thrombosis, the development of guidelines for the use of hormonal contraceptives in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic is necessary. In this context, the Korean Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health provides guidelines for issues regarding contraception and reproductive health during the pandemic."
Maintaining the Uptake of Peritoneal Dialysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Research Letter,"BACKGROUND: Due to inherent challenges in maintaining physical distancing in hemodialysis units, the Canadian Society of Nephrology has recommended peritoneal dialysis as the preferred modality for patients requiring maintenance dialysis during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, pursuing peritoneal dialysis is not without risk due to the requirement for in-person contact during catheter insertion and training, and there is a paucity of data regarding the experience of peritoneal dialysis during the early phases of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence and outcomes of peritoneal dialysis between March 17 and June 01, 2020 compared to the same time period in preceding years. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: British Columbia, Canada. After the pandemic was declared on March 17, 2020, patients continued to be trained in peritoneal dialysis. In an effort to limit time spent in hospital, patients were preferentially trained in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, training times were truncated for some patients, and peritoneal dialysis catheters were inserted by a physician at the bedside whenever feasible. PATIENTS: All patients aged >18 years who started chronic maintenance dialysis during the period March 17 to June 01 in the years 2018 to 2020 inclusive. The time period was extended to include the years 2010 to 2020 inclusive to evaluate longer term trends in dialysis incidence. MEASUREMENTS: A provincial clinical information system was used to capture the date of commencing dialysis, dialysis modality, and complications including peritonitis. Overall uptake of peritoneal dialysis included new starts and transitions to peritoneal dialysis from in-center hemodialysis during the observation period. METHODS: The incidence of dialysis during the specified time period, overall and by modality, was calculated per million population using census figures for the population at risk. Patients were followed for a minimum of 30 days from the start of peritoneal dialysis to capture episodes of peritonitis and COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 211 patients started maintenance dialysis between March 17 and June 01, 2020. The incidence dialysis rate (41.3 per million population) was lower than that expected based on the 10-year trend from 2010 to 2019 inclusive (expected rate 45.7 per million population, 95% confidence interval 41.7 to 50.1). A total of 93 patients started peritoneal dialysis, including 32 patients who transitioned from in-center hemodialysis, contributing to a higher overall uptake of peritoneal dialysis compared to preceding years. The incidence rate for peritoneal dialysis of 18.2 per million population was higher than that expected (16.3 per million population, 95% confidence interval 14.0 to 19.0). Half of patients (48%) underwent a bedside peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion by a physician. During 30 days of follow-up, 2 (2.2%) patients experienced peritonitis and no patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. LIMITATIONS: Results are short term and generalizable only to regions with similarly low community rates of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that peritoneal dialysis can be safely started and perhaps expanded as a means of mitigating the anticipated surge in in-center hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Important contributors to the uptake of peritoneal dialysis in British Columbia were bedside catheter insertions and expediting transitions from in-center hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis."
Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity,"Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic."
Impact of PBP4 Alterations on β-Lactam Resistance and Ceftobiprole Non-Susceptibility Among Enterococcus faecalis Clinical Isolates,"Penicillin-resistance among Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates has been recently associated with overexpression or aminoacidic substitutions in low-affinity PBP4. Ceftobiprole (BPR), a new-generation cephalosporin, is a therapeutic option against E. faecalis. Here, we present evidence that pbp4 gene sequence alterations may influence the expression level of the gene and ceftobiprole binding to PBP4 in E. faecalis clinical isolates showing remarkable MDR-phenotypes, and how this could interfere with BPR in vitro antibacterial and bactericidal activity. Seven E. faecalis strains from bloodstream infections were analyzed for their antibiotic and β-lactam resistance. BPR bactericidal activity was assessed by time-kill analysis; pbp4 genes were sequenced and pbp4 relative expression levels of transcription were performed by RT-qPCR. Five penicillin-resistant ampicillin-susceptible (PRAS) isolates were detected, 4 of which were also BPR non-susceptible (BPR-NS). In the time-kill experiments, BPR exposure resulted in a potent bactericidal activity (3-5 log(10) reduction) at the different concentrations tested. pbp4 gene sequence analysis revealed some mutations that may account for the changes in PBP4 affinity and MIC increase in the 4 BPR-NS strains (MICs 4-16 mg/L): the deletion of an adenine (delA) in the promoter region in all PRAS/BPR-NS strains; 12 different amino acid substitutions, 7 of which were next to the PBP catalytic-sites. The most significant were: T418A, located 6 amino acids (aa) upstream of the catalytic-serine included in the (424)STFK(427) motif I; L475Q, 7 aa upstream of the (482)SDN(484) motif II; V606A and the novel Y605H, 13/14 aa upstream of the (619)KTGT(622) motif III. Taken together, our data showed that elevated BPR MICs were attributable to increased transcription of pbp4 - associated with a single upstream adenine deletion and PBP4 alterations in the catalytic-site motifs – which might interfere with the formation of the BPR/PBP4 complex. pbp4 molecular alterations may account for the changes in PBP4 affinity and MIC increase, without affecting BPR cidal activity. Indeed, our in vitro dynamic analysis by time-kill assays showed that BPR exerted a bactericidal activity against E. faecalis clinical isolates, despite their MDR phenotypes."
Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in clinical specimens and clinical characteristics of 10 patients with COVID-19 in Macau,"As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the ""Severe"" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the ""Mild to Moderate"" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified."
COVID-19 Pandemic and Volume of Cardiac Catheterization Procedures in Jordan: Impact of Strict Lockdown,"INTRODUCTION: Global surge of COVID-19 forced most countries to impose variable measures to curb the disease. Jordan imposed one of the strictest lockdowns from mid-March through April 2020. Hospitals deferred elective cardiac catheterization procedures and most of those performed during that period were limited to urgent presentations. Our purpose is to evaluate the impact of strict lockdown on cardiac catheterization procedural volume. METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected data about the numbers of all coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed in 5 tertiary care hospitals in Amman, Jordan, from January through June 2020. We compared the volume of procedures performed in April 2020 (the strict lockdown month) to the corresponding period of prior year (April 2019) and to volumes performed prior to the lockdown in January–February 2020. There was a 64% decline in CA and PCI volumes in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Comparing number of procedures performed in April 2020 to those in January–February 2020, there was 59% decline in CA and a 60% decline in PCI volumes. Following partial lifting of lockdown in May–June 2020, procedural volumes increased gradually. CONCLUSION: Strict COVID-19-related lockdown in Jordan was associated with drastic declines in cardiac catheterization procedural volumes."

Robust Antibody Responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Occur Within a Week After the First Dose in Previously Infected Individuals and After the Second Dose in Uninfected Individuals,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can trigger acquired immunity in infection-naïve individuals and offer a path toward ending the coronavirus disease pandemic that began in 2019. However, the kinetics of early antibody responses in vaccinated individuals remain poorly understood. METHOD: We followed BNT162b2 mRNA-vaccinated health care workers (HCWs, N=108) including 103 infection-naïve and five previously infected individuals. A total of 763 blood samples were collected weekly or hourly basis before and after vaccination. Serological analysis of anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies was performed. RESULTS: Seroconversion occurred in all infection-naïve HCWs 3 weeks after the first dose (just before the second vaccination) and a marked boosting effect was observed at 4 weeks (1 week after the second dose). Among previously infected HCWs with pre-existing antibodies against the spike protein, a remarkable boosting effect was observed during the first week after vaccination, and a further increase in antibody titres was observed after the second dose. In one previously infected patient, daily blood sampling was conducted. Antibody titres began to increase 96 hours (4 days) after the first dose. CONCLUSION: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine remarkably enhanced antibody responses after the second dose in infection-naïve individuals and after the first dose in previously infected HCWs of all ages and genders. Antibody titres decreased slightly after the 5(th) week post-vaccination. The robust boosting effect of immunisation suggests that increased antibody titres following exposure to the virus may restrict viral replication, prolong the incubation period, or lessen the severity of disease."
Spontaneous perirenal haematoma (SPH) in a COVID-19 patient: A rare case report,"Spontaneous subcapsular renal hematoma (SPH) is a rare diagnostic dilemma in clinical practice. We report a strange case of SPH in COVID-19 patients. A 40-year-old female patient who had no past medical history of urogenital disorder was taken to the emergency room with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was found to have a subcapsular, non-expanding, non-pulsatile retroperitoneal hematoma in the periphery of the right kidney based on surgical exploration. Symptoms and size of the collection decreased on conservative treatment. We suggest that COVID-19 can cause a spontaneous hemorrhage in healthy and young people."
A Simple Method to Detect SARS-CoV-2 in Wastewater at Low Virus Concentration,"BACKGROUND: Since its initial appearance in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally. Wastewater surveillance has been demonstrated as capable of identifying infection clusters early. The purpose of this study was to investigate a quick and simple method to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Thailand during the early stages of the second outbreak wave when the prevalence of the disease and the virus concentration in wastewater were low. METHODS: Wastewater samples were collected from a hospital caring for patients with COVID-19 and from 35 markets, two of which were associated with recently reported COVID-19 cases. Then, samples were concentrated by membrane filtering prior to SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the wastewater samples from the hospital; the Ct values for the N, ORF1ab, and S genes progressively increased as the number of patients admitted to the treatment floor decreased. Notably, the ORF1ab and S genes were still detectable in wastewater even when only one patient with COVID-19 remained at the hospital. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the wastewater samples from fresh market where COVID-19 cases were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive and can detect the virus even in places with a high ambient temperature and relatively low prevalence of COVID-19."
Early experience with the Impella pump: Single-center registry,"BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of mechanical circulatory support technologies, patients presenting with cardiogenic shock have gained access to various treatment opportunities which were not until recently available. The Impella® pump (Abiomed, Danvers, USA) is a minimally invasive device which provides excellent left ventricular unloading and full circulatory support. The aim of the study was to review our center's experience with Impella® and to analyze the major adverse events associated with the device. METHODS: From January 2020 to January 2022, a total of 32 patients underwent Impella® implantation at our center for various indications. RESULTS: The mean age at surgery was 60.3 ± 12.4 years and 9.4% were female. All patients presented with acute cardiogenic shock in INTERMACS Class I (53.1%) and INTERMACS Class II (46.9%). Twenty-six patients (81.25%) out of the whole cohort have been mobilized on Impella® support. Seventeen patients (53.1%) have been weaned from the Impella® support and 10 patients (31.3%) have been bridged to durable LVAD. The median time on Impella® was 7 days (IQR 5.0-11.0). 30-day mortality was 37.5%, with 56.25% survival until hospital discharge. Only one patient developed vascular complications consisting of arm hypoperfusion. There were no cases of stroke on Impella® support. CONCLUSION: The Impella® axial-flow pump seems an appropriate therapeutic option for patients with acute cardiogenic shock requiring partial or full hemodynamic support. It also provides sufficient left ventricular unloading to allow full mobilization and neurological assessment of the patients. Furthermore, Impella® offers a high rate of myocardial recovery."
BIP4COVID19: Releasing impact measures for articles relevant to COVID-19,"Since the beginning of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, a large number of relevant articles has been published or become available in preprint servers. These articles, along with earlier related literature, compose a valuable knowledge base affecting contemporary research studies, or even government actions to limit the spread of the disease and treatment decisions taken by physicians. However, the number of such articles is increasing at an intense rate making the exploration of the relevant literature and the identification of useful knowledge in it challenging. In this work, we describe BIP4COVID19, an open dataset compiled to facilitate the coronavirus-related literature exploration, by providing various indicators of scientific impact for the relevant articles. Additionally, we provide a publicly accessible Web interface on top of our data, allowing the exploration of the publications based on the computed indicators."
Harnessing Digital Health Technologies to Remotely Manage Diabetic Foot Syndrome: A Narrative Review,"About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes and approximately one-third of them have a major risk factor for diabetic foot ulcers, including poor sensation in their feet from peripheral neuropathy and/or poor perfusion to their feet from peripheral artery disease. The current healthcare ecosystem, which is centered on the treatment of established foot disease, often fails to adequately control key reversible risk factors to prevent diabetic foot ulcers leading to unacceptable high foot disease amputation rate, 40% recurrence of ulcers rate in the first year, and high hospital admissions. Thus, the latest diabetic foot ulcer guidelines emphasize that a paradigm shift in research priority from siloed hospital treatments to innovative integrated community prevention is now critical to address the high diabetic foot ulcer burden. The widespread uptake and acceptance of wearable and digital health technologies provide a means to timely monitor major risk factors associated with diabetic foot ulcer, empower patients in self-care, and effectively deliver the remote monitoring and multi-disciplinary prevention needed for those at-risk people and address the health care access disadvantage that people living in remote areas. This narrative review paper summarizes some of the latest innovations in three specific areas, including technologies supporting triaging high-risk patients, technologies supporting care in place, and technologies empowering self-care. While many of these technologies are still in infancy, we anticipate that in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic and current unmet needs to decentralize care for people with foot disease, we will see a new wave of innovations in the area of digital health, smart wearables, telehealth technologies, and “hospital-at-home” care delivery model. These technologies will be quickly adopted at scale to improve remote management of diabetic foot ulcers, smartly triaging those who need to be seen in outpatient or inpatient clinics, and supporting acute or subacute care at home."

Does temperature matter for COVID-19 transmissibility? Evidence across Pakistani provinces,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global concern that is deteriorating environmental quality and damaging human health. Though some researchers have investigated the linkage between temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility across different geographical locations and over time, yet these studies are scarce. This study aims to bridge this gap using daily temperature and COVID-19 cases (transmissibility) by employing grey incidence analysis (GIA) models (i.e., Deng’s grey incidence analysis (DGIA), the absolute degree GIA (ADGIA), the second synthetic degree GIA (SSDGIA), the conservative (maximin) model) and correlation analysis. Data on temperature are accessed from the NASA database, while the data on COVID-19 cases are collected from the official website of the government of Pakistan. Empirical results reveal the existence of linkages between temperature and COVID-19 in all Pakistani provinces. These linkages vary from a relatively stronger to a relatively weaker linkage. Based on calculated weights, the strength of linkages is ranked across provinces as follows: Gilgit Baltistan (0.715301) > Baluchistan (0.675091) > Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (0.619893) > Punjab (0.619286) > Sindh (0.601736). The disparity in the strength of linkage among provinces is explained by the discrepancy in the intensity of temperature. Besides, the diagrammatic correlation analysis shows that temperature is inversely linked to COVID-19 cases (per million persons) over time, implying that low temperatures are associated with high COVID-19 transmissibility and vice versa. This study is among the first of its kind to consider the linkages between temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility for a tropical climate country (Pakistan) using the advanced GIA models. Research findings provide an up-to-date glimpse of the outbreak and emphasize the need to raise public awareness about the devastating impacts of the COVID-19. The educational syllabus should provide information on the causes, signs, and precautions of the pandemic. Additionally, individuals should practice handwashing, social distancing, personal hygiene, mask-wearing, and the use of hand sanitizers to ensure a secure and supportive atmosphere for preventing and controlling the current pandemic."
"Contesting the Crisis Narrative: Epidemic Accounts in Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Tanzania","In the early months of COVID-19 pandemic, scientists and global commentators watched African countries closely, predicting an impending disaster as the virus was projected to overwhelm already weak health systems. These expectations were informed by imaginaries of Africa as an inevitable site of epidemic disaster. This paper draws on accounts in Tanzania, Sierra Leone and Democratic Republic of Congo to contrast global catastrophe framings with everyday imaginations and experiences of crisis and crisis management. Drawing on ethnographic research, we explore how COVID-19 was understood in relation to previous epidemics, from HIV to Ebola, as well as political conflict. We then consider how global crisis narratives both inform and sit in tension with everyday collective and personal experiences. The paper brings these empirical reflections in conversation with theoretical debates around the discursive construction of crisis and its effects, and argues that these tensions matter because crisis framings have consequences."
Misconstrued Notions and Misplaced Interventions: An Assessment of State Policy on Domestic Work in India,"Given the informal employment relationship that marks the paid domestic work sector, this paper examines the important state interventions in India which follow the ILO convention on domestic work. The understanding that the sector is homogenous and thus could be regulated or managed through uniform intervention, whether legal or otherwise, has prevailed. This was even when existing studies have demonstrated the existence of segmented labour markets with varying employer, work and worker identities. The extension of the Minimum Wages Act to domestic workers, the draft National Policy on Domestic Work, and the Domestic Workers Sector Skill Council (DWSSC) set up under the National Skill Development Council of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship of Government of India, are examined in the paper in detail. The paper highlights how various state interventions have outlined the sector, the work, the workers and their everyday experiences and negotiations in terms of extending or framing these interventions. Examining the assumptions and objectives that have defined the formation of Domestic Workers Sector Skill Development council and its functioning, the paper argues that the attempt to corporatize the sector is a classic case of how the state tends to ignore the specificities that feature the sector leading to its poor impact."
Diarrhées aiguës infectieuses,"Acute infectious diarrhea has various causes: bacterial diarrhea with invasive or toxigenic mechanisms, especially frequent in hot regions and in travelers; viral diarrheas, frequent and cosmopolitan in children but also adults; and parasitic diarrhea, less frequent, and generally in subtropical areas. The major concerns involve the risk of complications, essentially dehydration and malnutrition, especially in vulnerable patients: young children, the elderly, and patients with immunosuppression, for whom rehydration is urgent. Diagnosis of diarrhea requires clinical assessment and history: underlying illnesses, severity of symptoms, presence and extent of dehydration and other clinical symptoms, travel history, known outbreaks, and pathogenic mechanism (invasive or toxigenic). Initial therapy should always include oral or parenteral rehydration; antimotility agents are generally not indicated; specific antibiotic treatment is not systematically indicated, except for invasive or dysenteric diarrhea and in immunosuppressed patients."
"In the Era of mRNA Vaccines, Is There Any Hope for HIV Functional Cure?","Over 36 million people worldwide are infected with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven to be highly effective to prevent HIV-1 transmission, clinical progression and death. Despite this success, the number of HIV-1 infected individuals continues increasing and ART should be taken for life. Therefore, there are two main priorities: the development of preventive vaccines to protect from HIV acquisition and achieve an efficient control of HIV infection in the absence of ART (functional cure). In this sense, in the last few years, there has been a broad interest in new and innovative approaches such as mRNA-based vaccines. RNA-based immunogens represent a promising alternative to conventional vaccines because of their high potency, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration. Some mRNA-based vaccines platforms against infectious diseases have demonstrated encouraging results in animal models and humans. However, their application is still limited because the instability and inefficient in vivo delivery of mRNA. Immunogens, design, immunogenicity, chemical modifications on the molecule or the vaccine delivery methods are all crucial interventions for improvement. In this review we, will present the current knowledge and challenges in this research field. mRNA vaccines hold great promises as part of a combined strategy, for achieving HIV functional cure."

Organizing an Orthopaedic Department During COVID-19 Pandemic to Mitigate In-Hospital Transmission: Experience From Greece,"The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerging in Wuhan city of China, was the cause of a rare type of pneumonia evolving rapidly in pandemic early at the beginning of 2020. The rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 increases the risk of in-hospital transmission, requiring re-definement of musculoskeletal trauma management and postoperative care. Following the review of the existing literature on COVID-19 and similar infectious diseases, National and Hospital Board instructions for Infectious Diseases, as well as the consensus for surgical care by the consortium of the Orthopaedic Department Directors, we present the outline of the implemented principles in the orthopaedic departments of a tertiary academic hospital in Greece to operate during COVID-19 pandemic. Our overall objectives were to decrease the admission load and mitigate the risk of in-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The principles involve the management of the Orthopaedic medical and nursing personnel, alterations of the workflow in the wards, operating rooms and outpatient clinics from the admission to the discharge of an orthopaedic patient. In addition, we present the recommended principles of management of traumatic orthopaedic injuries highlighting those deserving admission and in-hospital care and those that can be treated in the outpatient setting or day surgery clinics."
Hot topics en infecciones respiratorias,"Resumen Se efectúa una revisión de los artículos más interesantes de infecciones respiratorias, publicados en el último trimestre del año 2009 y en 2010. En cuanto a las bronquiectasias, destacan las Guidelines de la British Thoracic Society, así como diversos artículos de la evolución natural del proceso y el impacto de las reagudizaciones de ésta, así como del tratamiento inhalatorio antibiótico de las bronquiectasias. Con respecto a la tuberculosis, es recomendable señalar el documento de consenso SEPAR-SEIMC para el manejo de la tuberculosis, así como las publicaciones sobre la utilización de interferón-gamma en el diagnóstico de infección tuberculosa. Las nuevas recomendaciones SEPAR de neumonía adquirida en la comunidad (NAC) se han publicado muy recientemente, y junto con ellas destacan estudios de etiología viral de las NAC, impacto del tratamiento corticoideo en las neumonías, duración del tratamiento antibiótico y medidas preventivas de neumonías, tanto comunitarias como nosocomiales. Abstract We review the most interesting articles on respiratory infections published in the last trimester of 2009 and in 2010. Notable publications in bronchiectasis were the Guidelines of the British Thoracic Society, as well as several articles on the natural course of the process, the impact of exacerbations on the course of the disease, and treatment with inhaled antibiotics. Other notable publications were the SEPAR-SEIMC consensus document for the management of tuberculosis and articles on the use of interferon-gamma in the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection. The new recommendations of the Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery on community-acquired pneumonia have recently been published. Equally important are studies on the viral etiology of community-acquired pneumonia, the impact of corticosteroid treatment in pneumonia, the duration of antibiotic therapy and preventive measures in both community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia."
The mental health impact of COVID-19 and lockdown-related stressors among adults in the UK,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and subsequent lockdown may have affected the mental health of the population. This study examines whether there was an increase in the prevalence and incidence of common mental disorders (CMD) in the UK adult population during the first months of lockdown and whether changes in CMD were associated with stressors related to the pandemic and lockdown. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study waves 10–11: 2019–2020 and waves 1–4 of the COVID-19 monthly surveys in April (n = 17 761) to July 2020 (n = 13 754), a representative sample of UK adult population, were analysed. CMD was measured using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (cut-off >2). Changes in CMD were analysed in relation to COVID-19 and social stressors. RESULTS: Around 29% of adults without CMD less than a year earlier had a CMD in April 2020. However, by July 2020, monthly incidence of CMD had reduced to 9%. Most employment, financial and psychological ‘shocks’ were at their highest levels in April and reduced steadily in later months. Despite the lifting of some lockdown conditions by July, stressors related to loneliness, unemployment, financial problems and domestic work continued to influence CMD. CONCLUSION: Some COVID-19 policy responses such as furloughing may have been effective in mitigating the increase in CMD for some groups of employees. Despite some reduction in levels of pandemic and lockdown-related stressors by the middle of 2020, loneliness and financial stressors remained key determinants of incidence in CMD among the UK adult population."
A Multicenter Study of Viral Aetiology of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Hospitalized Children in Chinese Mainland,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. In this study, we aimed to describe the aetiology of viral infection of pediatric CAP in Chinese mainland. During November 2014 to June 2016, the prospective study was conducted in 13 hospitals. The hospitalized children under 18 years old who met the criteria for CAP were enrolled. The throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected which were then screened 18 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR assay. Viral pathogens were present in 56.6% (1539/2721) of the enrolled cases, with the detection rate of single virus in 39.8% of the cases and multiple viruses in 16.8% of the cases. The most frequently detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (15.2%, 414/2721). The highest detection rate of virus was in < 6-month-age group (70.7%, 292/413). RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) and influenza B virus (Flu B) showed the similar prevalence patterns both in north and south China, but HPIVs, Flu A, human bocavirus (HBoV), human adenovirus (HAdV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) showed the distinct circulating patterns in north and south China. Human enterovirus/human rhinovirus (HEV/HRV) (27.6%, 27/98), HBoV (18.4%, 18/98), RSV (16.3%, 16/98) and HMPV (14.3%, 14/98) were the most commonly detected viruses in severe pneumonia cases with single virus infection. In conclusion, viral pathogens are frequently detected in pediatric CAP cases and may therefore play a vital role in the aetiology of CAP. RSV was the most important virus in hospitalized children with CAP in Chinese mainland. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12250-021-00437-0."
Dry mouth in the seriously ill and dying./ Munntørrhet hos alvorlig syke og døende,"Dry mouth constitutes a significant problem for most patients with grave illnesses and a need for palliative treatment. The main causes are pharmaceuticals, diseases and cancer treatment, which are often associated with increasing age. The condition may give rise to discomfort, pain, dysphagia, speech problems, increased caries activity, dehydration, malnutrition and loss of appetite. There are few evidence-based remedies against this condition. An apparently trivial problem like dry mouth may therefore cause deterioration of the clinical picture and a reduced quality of life."
Developing Social Entrepreneurship as an Intervention to Enhance Disadvantaged Young People’s Sense of Self-Worth and Career Competence in Hong Kong,"This is the first empirical research in Hong Kong to examine the impact of social entrepreneurship training on disadvantaged young peoples’ career competence including their self-perceived employability, entrepreneurial knowledge, skills and intent, and their psychosocial development including their self-esteem, resilience, and career-linked self-efficacy. The subjects of this research were in-school youths and school drop-outs who joined the three waves of “Social-Up Youth Entrepreneurship Programme” including social entrepreneurship training (T1), internship (T2), and a pre-incubation project funded by a Charities Trust in Hong Kong. This research included a quantitative part, that is, questionnaires, and qualitative part, that is, focus group and individual interviews. At the time of data analysis, 100 disadvantaged young people joined the program at the baseline measure (T0). Only 77 and 31 could be matched and sufficient enough for data analysis at T1 and T2, respectively. The results demonstrated that social entrepreneurship training is positive and promising to enhance disadvantaged young peoples’ sense of self-worth and resilience, their entrepreneurial knowledge and skills, and overall self-perceived employability. The impact of the interactive and experiential-oriented social entrepreneurship training was the most significant. The impact of the internship was influenced by the extra burdens added to in-school youths. Because of its potential positive effects, further examination is required.

Adverse outcomes in COVID-19 and diabetes: a retrospective cohort study from three London teaching hospitals,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with diabetes mellitus admitted to hospital with COVID-19 have poorer outcomes. However, the drivers of poorer outcomes are not fully elucidated. We performed detailed characterization of patients with COVID-19 to determine the clinical and biochemical factors that may be drivers of poorer outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 889 consecutive inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 9 and April 22, 2020 in a large London National Health Service Trust. Unbiased multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine variables that were independently and significantly associated with increased risk of death and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 62% of patients in our cohort were of non-white ethnic background and the prevalence of diabetes was 38%. 323 (36%) patients met the primary outcome of death/admission to the ICU within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Male gender, lower platelet count, advancing age and higher Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score (but not diabetes) independently predicted poor outcomes on multivariate analysis. Antiplatelet medication was associated with a lower risk of death/ICU admission. Factors that were significantly and independently associated with poorer outcomes in patients with diabetes were coexisting ischemic heart disease, increasing age and lower platelet count. CONCLUSIONS: In this large study of a diverse patient population, comorbidity (ie, diabetes with ischemic heart disease; increasing CFS score in older patients) was a major determinant of poor outcomes with COVID-19. Antiplatelet medication should be evaluated in randomized clinical trials among high-risk patient groups."

Evolution of the Chinese guarantee network under financial crisis and stimulus program,"Our knowledge about the evolution of guarantee network in downturn period is limited due to the lack of comprehensive data of the whole credit system. Here we analyze the dynamic Chinese guarantee network constructed from a comprehensive bank loan dataset that accounts for nearly 80% total loans in China, during 01/2007-03/2012. The results show that, first, during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the guarantee network became smaller, less connected and more stable because of many bankruptcies; second, the stimulus program encouraged mutual guarantee behaviors, resulting in highly reciprocal and fragile network structure; third, the following monetary policy adjustment enhanced the resilience of the guarantee network by reducing mutual guarantees. Interestingly, our work reveals that the financial crisis made the network more resilient, and conversely, the government bailout degenerated network resilience. These counterintuitive findings can provide new insight into the resilience of real-world credit system under external shocks or rescues."
Amelioration of Endotoxemia by a Synthetic Analog of Omega-3 Epoxyeicosanoids,"Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to pathogenic factors, is a difficult to treat life-threatening condition associated with cytokine and eicosanoid storms and multi-organ damage. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid, are the precursors of potent anti-inflammatory lipid mediators, including 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-EEQ), the main metabolite of EPA generated by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. Searching for novel therapeutic or preventative agents in sepsis, we tested a metabolically robust synthetic analog of 17,18-EEQ (EEQ-A) for its ability to reduce mortality, organ damage, and pro-inflammatory cytokine transcript level in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia, which is closely related to sepsis. Overall survival significantly improved following preventative EEQ-A administration along with decreased transcript level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the other hand, the therapeutic protocol was effective in improving survival at 48 hours but insignificant at 72 hours. Histopathological analyses showed significant reductions in hemorrhagic and necrotic damage and infiltration in the liver. In vitro studies with THP-1 and U937 cells showed EEQ-A mediated repression of LPS-induced M1 polarization and enhancement of IL-4-induced M2 polarization of macrophages. Moreover, EEQ-A attenuated the LPS-induced decline of mitochondrial function in THP-1 cells, as indicated by increased basal respiration and ATP production as well as reduction of the metabolic shift to glycolysis. Taken together, these data demonstrate that EEQ-A has potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that may support therapeutic strategies for ameliorating the endotoxemia."

Social distancing and reopening universities after the COVID-19 pandemic: policy complexity in G20 countries,"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected the entire globe, and various mythologies argue about its diagnosis, cure, and prevention. Globally, as of September 18(th), 2020, there have been 30.055 million confirmed cases, including 0.943 million deaths. The nationwide closures are impacting over 60% of the world’s student population. This study aimed to explore the social distancing policies and universities’ reopening after COVID-19 in G20 countries (19 member countries and the European Union). Design and Methods: The study is based on documentary analysis. G20 members represent around 80% of the world’s economic output, two-thirds of the global population (including more than half of the world’s poor), and 75% of international trade. Based on documentary analysis, the study revealed that there is a policy dilemma among G20 countries regarding school reopening and a variety of conflicting policies within each country. Results: Based on a sample of 838 universities in the USA, 66% of universities (552 of 838) plan for in-person instruction, while only 7% are planning for a completely online teaching mode in the fall 2020 semester. Conclusions: Interestingly, none of the private universities in this study are planning to implement an online teaching mode. Policymakers need an integrated set of policy guidelines for school reopening, considering the evaluation of current COVID- 19 pandemic circumstances and social distancing capacity."

Optimization of fractional-order chaotic cellular neural networks by metaheuristics,"Artificial neural networks have demonstrated to be very useful in solving problems in artificial intelligence. However, in most cases, ANNs are considered integer-order models, limiting the possible applications in recent engineering problems. In addition, when dealing with fractional-order neural networks, almost any work shows cases when varying the fractional order. In this manner, we introduce the optimization of a fractional-order neural network by applying metaheuristics, namely: differential evolution (DE) and accelerated particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithms. The case study is a chaotic cellular neural network (CNN), for which the main goal is generating fractional orders of the neurons whose Kaplan–Yorke dimension is being maximized. We propose a method based on Fourier transform to evaluate if the generated time series is chaotic or not. The solutions that do not have chaotic behavior are not passed to the time series analysis (TISEAN) software, thus saving execution time. We show the best solutions provided by DE and APSO of the attractors of the fractional-order chaotic CNNs."
Identification of Rat Testicular Leydig Precursor Cells by Single-Cell-RNA-Sequence Analysis,"Stem Leydig cells (SLCs) play a critical role in the development and maintenance of the adult Leydig cell (ALC) population. SLCs also are present in the adult testis. Their identification, characteristics, and regulation in the adult testis remain uncertain. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found that the mesenchymal stromal population may be involved in ALC regeneration. Upon ALC elimination, a fraction of stromal cells begins to proliferate while a different fraction begins to differentiate to ALCs. Transcriptomic analysis identified five stromal clusters that can be classified into two major groups representing proliferation and differentiation populations. The proliferating group represents stem cells expressing high levels of CD90, Nes, Lum, Fn and Gap43. The differentiating group represents a progenitor stage that is ready to form ALCs, and specifically expresses Vtn, Rasl11a, Id1 and Egr2. The observation that the actively dividing cells after ALC loss were not those that formed ALCs suggests that stem cell proliferation and differentiation are regulated separately, and that the maintenance of the stromal stem cell pool occurs at the population level. The study also identified specific markers for the major interstitial cell groups and potential paracrine factors involved in the regulation of SLCs. Our data suggest a new theory about SLC identity, proliferation, differentiation, and regulation."
Time Course of MERS-CoV Infection and Immunity in Dromedary Camels,"Knowledge about immunity to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in dromedary camels is essential for infection control and vaccination. A longitudinal study of 11 dam–calf pairs showed that calves lose maternal MERS-CoV antibodies 5–6 months postparturition and are left susceptible to infection, indicating a short window of opportunity for vaccination."
The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Ophthalmology Residents: A Narrative Review,"The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically affected medical societies. We aim to provide an overview and summarize the information published so far concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology residency programs and the mental wellbeing of trainees, and to establish factors to help maintain successful residency training to ensure high-quality, specialist ophthalmic training. A literature search was conducted in October 2021 of the PubMed database for articles assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of ophthalmology trainees and on ophthalmology residency programs. Cross-sectional survey studies, editorials, articles in scientific journals, letters to editors, and commentaries were considered; finally, 19 studies were included after excluding abstract-only publications and conference posters. The studies’ demographic details, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and limitations were extracted. Our summarized information showed the alarmingly significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology trainees’ mental health and the associated considerable changes in ophthalmic training programs. Thus, in future, virtual training and surgical simulators should be permanently introduced, in addition to traditional teaching, to complete successful ophthalmology residency programs. Additionally, we emphasize the need for a widely facilitated and encouraged access to psychological support programs for healthcare workers, including ophthalmologists."
Challenges of delivering reproductive health services to forced displaced populations,"BACKGROUND: Of the 80 million forced displaced persons worldwide, women and children bear greater morbidity and mortality, especially in conflict-affected regions. This is due to disruption in health service provision, breakdown of social institutions and increase in sexual and gender-based violence. Reproductive health (RH) service delivery as part of humanitarian health cluster services is outlined in the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP). This study explores the challenges of delivering RH services to forced-displaced populations, focussing on field level stakeholders in humanitarian settings. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders from non-governmental and United Nations agencies involved in delivering RH services to conflict-affected populations. Additionally, a scoping review, using the Arksey and O'Malley framework, of the literature was also conducted reviewing challenges of delivering RH programmes to women in forced displaced populations. An inductive and deductive thematic approach was used in data analysis. RESULTS: Eleven key informants (KIs) were interviewed from six conflict-affected countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Libya. Main emerging themes were: 1. Poor awareness of international guidelines (including the MISP) 2. Service provision barriers including lack of human resources 3. Attitudes towards SRH and women's rights 4. Disruption of health services due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study has highlighted the main challenges that the humanitarian actors delivering RH programmes in conflict-affected settings face. Implementation of international guidelines remains a key barrier. Key policy recommendations would be to standardise training for all RH providers, prioritise training in the MISP and address cultural attitudes towards RH. Further research exploring the use of WHO's essential medicines for RH and the long-term impact of COVID-19 on forced displaced females needs to be conducted. KEY MESSAGES: Providing basic essential reproductive health services to conflict affected populations remains a challenge, including implementation of standardised international guidance through the MISP. One key policy recommendation would be to prioritise training in MISP for conflict-affected humanitarian settings to ensure it is offered as part of the essential package."
Automatic Sleep-Arousal Detection with Single-Lead EEG Using Stacking Ensemble Learning.,"Poor-quality sleep substantially diminishes the overall quality of life. It has been shown that sleep arousal serves as a good indicator for scoring sleep quality. However, patients are conventionally asked to perform overnight polysomnography tests to collect their physiological data, which are used for the manual judging of sleep arousals. Even worse, not only is this process time-consuming and cumbersome, the judgment of sleep-arousal events is subjective and differs widely from expert to expert. Therefore, this work focuses on designing an automatic sleep-arousal detector that necessitates only a single-lead electroencephalogram signal. Based on the stacking ensemble learning framework, the automatic sleep-arousal detector adopts a meta-classifier that stacks four sub-models: one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, merged convolutional and recurrent networks, and random forest classifiers. This meta-classifier exploits both advantages from deep learning networks and conventional machine learning algorithms to enhance its performance. The embedded information for discriminating the sleep-arousals is extracted from waveform sequences, spectrum characteristics, and expert-defined statistics in single-lead EEG signals. Its effectiveness is evaluated using an open-accessed database, which comprises polysomnograms of 994 individuals, provided by PhysioNet. The improvement of the stacking ensemble learning over a single sub-model was up to 9.29%, 7.79%, 11.03%, 8.61% and 9.04%, respectively, in terms of specificity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve."
Adaptive short term COVID-19 prediction for India,"In this paper, a data-driven adaptive model for infection of COVID-19 is formulated to predict the confirmed total cases and active cases of an area over 4 weeks. The parameter of the model is always updated based on daily observations. It is found that the short term prediction of up to 3-4 weeks can be possible with good accuracy. Detailed analysis of predicted value and the actual value of confirmed total cases and active cases for India from 1st June to 3rd July is provided. Prediction over 7, 14, 21, 28 days has the accuracy about 0.73% {+/-} 1.97%, 1.92% {+/-} 2.95%, 4.34% {+/-} 3.91%, 6.40% {+/-} 9.26% of the actual value of confirmed total cases. Similarly, the 7, 14, 21, 28 days prediction has the accuracy about 1.24% {+/-} 6.57%, 3.04% {+/-} 10%, 6.33% {+/-} 16.12%, 10.2% {+/-} 24.14% of the actual value of confirmed active cases."
What influences COVID-19 infection rates: A statistical approach to identify promising factors applied to infection data from Germany,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic is of big and world-wide concern. There is an intense discussion and uncertainty which factors and sanctions can reduce infection rates. The overall aim is to prevent an overload of the medical system. Even within one country, there is frequently a strong local variability in both -- political sanctions as well as other local factors -- which may influence infection rates. The main focus of study is analysis and interpretation of recent temporal developments (infection rates). We present a statistical framework designed to identify local factors which reduce infection rates. The approach is robust with respect to the number of undetected infection cases. We apply the framework to spatio-temporal infection data from Germany. In particular, we demonstrate that (1) infection rates are in average significantly decreasing in Germany; (2) there is a high spatial variability of these rates, and (3) both, early emergence of first infections and high local infection densities has led to strong recent decays in infection rates, suggesting that psychological effects (such as awareness of danger) lead to behaviour changes that reduce infection rates. However, the full potential of the presented method cannot yet be exploited, since more precise spatio-temporal data, such as local cell phone-based mobility data, are not yet available. In the nearest future, the presented framework could be applied to data from other countries at any state of infection, even during the exponential phase of the growth of infection rates."
Targeting viral genome synthesis as broad-spectrum approach against RNA virus infections,"Zoonotic spillover, i.e. pathogen transmission from animal to human, has repeatedly introduced RNA viruses into the human population. In some cases, where these viruses were then efficiently transmitted between humans, they caused large disease outbreaks such as the 1918 flu pandemic or, more recently, outbreaks of Ebola and Coronavirus disease. These examples demonstrate that RNA viruses pose an immense burden on individual and public health with outbreaks threatening the economy and social cohesion within and across borders. And while emerging RNA viruses are introduced more frequently as human activities increasingly disrupt wild-life eco-systems, therapeutic or preventative medicines satisfying the “one drug-multiple bugs”-aim are unavailable. As one central aspect of preparedness efforts, this review digs into the development of broadly acting antivirals via targeting viral genome synthesis with host- or virus-directed drugs centering around nucleotides, the genomes’ universal building blocks. Following the first strategy, selected examples of host de novo nucleotide synthesis inhibitors are presented that ultimately interfere with viral nucleic acid synthesis, with ribavirin being the most prominent and widely used example. For directly targeting the viral polymerase, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues (NNAs) have long been at the core of antiviral drug development and this review illustrates different molecular strategies by which NNAs inhibit viral infection. Highlighting well-known as well as recent, clinically promising compounds, structural features and mechanistic details that may confer broad-spectrum activity are discussed. The final part addresses limitations of NNAs for clinical development such as low efficacy or mitochondrial toxicity and illustrates strategies to overcome these."
ASEAN’s Diplomatic Tasks During the Pandemic,"What are the implications of COVID-19 for the diplomacy of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)? What kinds of diplomatic tasks has the pandemic imposed on ASEAN, and in what way has the Southeast Asian association handled them? ASEAN’s most fundamental diplomatic task has of course been to continue building ASEAN communities, but the ability of the association of minor powers in Southeast Asia is limited. Hence, it can be said that ASEAN’s most important diplomatic task has been to maintain favorable relations with external powers, in particular, with China and the United States. The present study argues that ASEAN has managed to maintain favorable relations with and receive support from both of these external powers by conducting “equidistant diplomacy” with them. In concrete terms, it has fostered favorable relations with China. Yet, without relying excessively on Beijing, it made sure to foster such relations with the United States as well, thereby striking a reasonable balance between these two external powers."
Mask Phenomenon: Facial Petechiae in a COVID-19 “Long Hauler” Patient,
Information management hits and misses in the COVID19 emergency in Brazil,"Brazilian Federal Government created an emergency aid to face the COVID19 emergency. This aid provides monthly payments to low-income or unemployed citizens, informal workers, or individual micro-entrepreneurs. An intricate set of criteria made too complex the identification of all citizens eligible for emergency aid, considering there is no an integrated database to which they could apply these criteria. Consequently, lots of people who fulfilled the criteria were not able to receive the aid, and lots of people who were not supposed to get it ended up receiving it. In this context, the goal of this opinion paper is to discuss the process effectiveness and which issues related to information management hindered the positive program impact. Additionally, a less complex but relevant case of Rio Grande do Sul State is discussed. Both cases – the Federal Government and the state government – show the importance of effective information management to face very demanding situations and avoid the high social price to be paid by those who need this aid the most."

Food Habit Associated Mycobiota Composition and Their Impact on Human Health,"Mycobiota is not only associated with healthy homeostasis in the human gut but also helps to adapt to the environment. Food habits, alcohol consumption, intake of probiotics, and contaminated food with a mycotoxin, often lead to the alteration in the mycobiota composition. Impaired immunity of the host may affect fungal symbiosis leading to mycosis. The human gut adapts to the commensalism fungi belonging to the phylum Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Diet habits such as plant-or animal-based, phytoestrogens enriched plant products, fat-rich diets also influence the colonization of certain fungal species in the mammalian gut. Food habits or mycotoxin-contaminated food or fungal peptides have an impact on bacterial-fungal interaction and human health. The mycobiota population such as Fusarium, Humicola, Aspergillus, and Candida are altered due to alcohol intake in alcoholic liver disease. The role of associated gut mycobiota due to irregular bowel habits or lifestyle change has been observed in inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, it has been observed that Saccharomyces, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Cladosporium, Candida, and Malassezia were the common genus in the human mycobiota. Therefore, this study focused on how diet habits and alcohol intake, among others., influence mycobiota composition that may affect the human immune system or overall health."
Online dental teaching practices during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional online survey from China,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered dental education, as school buildings were closed. Online dental teaching provided an alternative teaching tool for dental education. However, the efficiency of online dental teaching and student preferences for online dental teaching are unclear. AIM: To investigate the satisfaction with online dental teaching practices among undergraduate dental students and standardized resident physician training students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A total of 104 undergraduate dental students and 57 standardized resident physician training students from Zhejiang University participated in the study. A 12-item survey was conducted. This investigation included the teaching methods received, frequency of classes, degree of satisfaction, preferred teaching method, whether to participate in a course regarding COVID-19 prevention, and the effects of teaching. The percentages were then calculated and evaluated for each item. RESULTS: A total of 161 students (104 undergraduate dental students and 57 standardized resident physician training students) participated in this survey. All students had online dental classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lecture-based learning (LBL), case-based learning (CBL), problem-based learning (PBL), team-based learning (TBL), and research-based learning (RBL) were selected as teaching methods. Students were more satisfied with LBL and CBL than PBL, RBL, and TBL. The majority of students had more than four classes per week. The most selected protective measures were hand washing, wearing masks, and wearing gloves. A total of 46.6% of students participated in courses on COVID-19. After training, the students consciously chose to wear face shields and protective clothing. CONCLUSIONS: Dental students accepted online dental learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students preferred LBL and CBL and were satisfied with the classes. Courses on COVID-19 helped students understand how to prevent COVID-19 transmission in the dental clinic."
"COVID-19 outbreak response, a dataset to assess mobility changes in Italy following national lockdown","Italy has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, reporting the highest death toll in Europe as of April 2020. Following the identification of the first infections, on February 21, 2020, national authorities have put in place an increasing number of restrictions aimed at containing the outbreak and delaying the epidemic peak. On March 12, the government imposed a national lockdown. To aid the evaluation of the impact of interventions, we present daily time-series of three different aggregated mobility metrics: the origin-destination movements between Italian provinces, the radius of gyration, and the average degree of a spatial proximity network. All metrics were computed by processing a large-scale dataset of anonymously shared positions of about 170,000 de-identified smartphone users before and during the outbreak, at the sub-national scale. This dataset can help to monitor the impact of the lockdown on the epidemic trajectory and inform future public health decision making."
Filamentous fungi for future functional food and feed,"In this review, we offer our opinion of current and expected trends regarding the use of mushrooms and mycelia in food and feed. Mushrooms have provided food for millennia and production methods and species diversity have recently expanded. Beyond mushrooms, cultured fungal mycelia are now harvested as a primary product for food. Mushrooms and mycelia provide dietary protein, lipids and fatty acids, vitamins, fibre, and flavour, and can improve the organoleptic properties of processed foods (including meat analogues). Further, they are often key ingredients in nutritional or therapeutic supplements because of diverse specialised metabolites. Mycelia can also improve feed conversion efficiency, gut health, and wellbeing in livestock. New molecular tools, coupled with quality genetic data, are improving production technologies, enabling the synthesis of specialised metabolites, and creating new processing and valorisation opportunities. Production systems for submerged culture are capital intensive, but investment is required considering the scale of the protein market."
Critical Sequence Hot-spots for Binding of nCOV-2019 to ACE2 as Evaluated by Molecular Simulations,"The novel coronavirus (nCOV-2019) outbreak has put the world on edge, causing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths all around the world, as of June 2020, let alone the societal and economic impacts of the crisis. The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virion’s surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally-occurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors. From an evolutional perspective, this study also identifies how the virus has evolved from its predecessor SARS-COV and how it could further evolve to become more infectious."
"Interleukin-17 inhibitor, is it safer than tumor necrosis factor inhibitor?",
The 2022 ANCC Institute for Credentialing Research and Quality Management Priorities: A Path Forward in Nurse-Led Research,"ABSTRACT: It is imperative that we listen to our nation's nurses, who have a unique vantage point from their clinical environments. Clinical research nurses have greatly contributed to studying the delivery of care over the years; however, since 2020, COVID-19 has brought unprecedented changes within the nursing profession. Each wave of the pandemic has created a worrisome landscape where nurse researchers face multiple challenges in implementing and funding practice-based nursing-led research projects. To raise nurses' voices and promote nurse-led research, the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) Research Council 2022 Research Priorities include the dissemination of a research agenda for practice-based research, promoting interprofessional research, and encouraging equitable and inclusive participation on research teams."
Statins and Bempedoic Acid: Different Actions of Cholesterol Inhibitors on Macrophage Activation,"Statins represent the most prescribed class of drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Effects that go beyond lipid-lowering actions have been suggested to contribute to their beneficial pharmacological properties. Whether and how statins act on macrophages has been a matter of debate. In the present study, we aimed at characterizing the impact of statins on macrophage polarization and comparing these to the effects of bempedoic acid, a recently registered drug for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, which has been suggested to have a similar beneficial profile but fewer side effects. Treatment of primary murine macrophages with two different statins, i.e., simvastatin and cerivastatin, impaired phagocytotic activity and, concurrently, enhanced pro-inflammatory responses upon short-term lipopolysaccharide challenge, as characterized by an induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL) 1β, and IL6. In contrast, no differences were observed under long-term inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) conditions, and neither inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression nor nitric oxide production was altered. Statin treatment led to extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) activation, and the pro-inflammatory statin effects were abolished by ERK inhibition. Bempedoic acid only had a negligible impact on macrophage responses when compared with statins. Taken together, our data point toward an immunomodulatory effect of statins on macrophage polarization, which is absent upon bempedoic acid treatment."
Delayed health consequences of Covid-19 lockdown in an older adult,"We report a case of a retired school teacher who presented with rapid cognitive and functional decline following the COVID-19 lockdown period that was diagnosed as worsening depression by referring physician. This highlights the potentially life-threatening consequences of delayed diagnosis and management of delirium, an often reversible syndrome, due to lockdown restrictions. As the pandemic outlives its initial projections, its downstream impact on an already vulnerable population continues to emerge."
Progress and pitfalls of a year of drug repurposing screens against COVID-19(),"Near the end of 2019, a new betacoronavirus started to efficiently transmit between humans, resulting in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Unprecedented worldwide efforts were made to identify and repurpose antiviral therapeutics from collections of approved drugs and known bioactive compounds. Typical pitfalls of this approach (promiscuous/cytotoxic compounds leading to false positives), combined with bypassing antiviral drug development parameters due to urgency have resulted in often disappointing outcomes. A flood of publications, press-releases, and media posts, created confusion in the general public and sometime mobilized precious resources for clinical trials with minimal prospect of success. Breakthroughs have been made, not in the laboratory but in the clinic, resulting from the empiric identification of mitigators of clinical signs such as the discovery of improved disease management through immunomodulators. This opinion piece will aim to capture some of the lessons that we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has taught about drug repurposing screens."
COVID-19 and cardiovascular system-a comprehensive review,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a mystified cryptic virus has challenged the mankind that has brought life to a standstill. Catastrophic loss of life, perplexed healthcare system and the downfall of global economy are some of the outcomes of this pandemic. Humans are raging a war with an unknown enemy. Infections, irrespective of age and gender, and more so in comorbidities are escalating at an alarming rate. Cardiovascular diseases, are the leading cause of death globally with an estimate of 31% of deaths worldwide out of which nearly 85% are due to heart attacks and stroke. Theoretically and practically, researchers have observed that persons with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions are comparatively more vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection. Moreover, they have studied the data between less severe and more severe cases, survivors and non survivors, intensive care unit (ICU) patients and non ICU patients, to analyse the relationship and the influence of COVID-19 on cardiovascular health of an individual, further the risk of susceptibility to submit to the virus. This review aims to provide a comprehensive particular on the possible effects, either direct or indirect, of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular heath of an individual."
"Impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on building energy consumption and indoor environment: A case study in Dalian, China","Restricting social distancing is an effective means of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a sharp drop in the utilization of commercial buildings. However, the specific changes in the operating parameters are not clear. This study aims to quantify the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on commercial building energy consumption and the indoor environment, including correlation analysis. A large green commercial building in Dalian, China's only country to experience five lockdowns, has been chosen. We compared the performance during the lockdown to the same period last year. The study found that the first lockdown caused a maximum 63.5% drop in monthly energy consumption, and the second lockdown was 55.2%. The energy consumption per unit area in 2020 dropped by 55.4% compared with 2019. In addition, during the lockdown, the compliance rate of indoor thermal environment increased by 34.7%, and indoor air quality was 9.5%. These findings could partly explain the short-term and far-reaching effects of the lockdown on the operating parameters of large commercial buildings. Humans are likely to coexist with COVID-19 for a long time, and commercial buildings have to adapt to new energy and health demands. Effective management strategies need to be developed."
Investor initiatives program: Public‐private partnerships to expedite commercialization for NCI‐funded small business entrepreneurs,"The National Cancer Institute’s Small Business Innovation Research Development Center (NCI SBIR) provides federal research and development funding and commercialization resources to more than 400 small businesses each year developing novel technologies to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer. Although federal funding is vital for life science startups at the early stage of development, it is often insufficient to translate the technology from discovery to commercial product. Early‐stage startups must connect to follow‐on capital and resources to bring NCI‐funded technologies to patients. Most startups face challenges in securing additional funding due to lack of access to investors and strategic partners and the ability to effectively pitch their technology. In 2015, the NCI SBIR started the Investor Initiatives program to connect funded small businesses with targeted investors and strategic partners to address the aforementioned obstacles. This program leverages an extensive network of investors and partners to conduct business‐focused reviews and provide pitch coaching. The program incentivizes earlier collaborations between NCI‐funded companies and private investors through various channels.

An overview of vaccine development for COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to endanger world health and the economy. The causative SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has a unique replication system. The end point of the COVID-19 pandemic is either herd immunity or widespread availability of an effective vaccine. Multiple candidate vaccines – peptide, virus-like particle, viral vectors (replicating and nonreplicating), nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), live attenuated virus, recombinant designed proteins and inactivated virus – are presently under various stages of expansion, and a small number of vaccine candidates have progressed into clinical phases. At the time of writing, three major pharmaceutical companies, namely Pfizer and Moderna, have their vaccines under mass production and administered to the public. This review aims to investigate the most critical vaccines developed for COVID-19 to date."
Clinical effectiveness of and family experience with telephone consultation in a regional pediatric neurosurgery center in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: Pediatric neurosurgery outpatient consultation is conducted face-to-face (FTF) conventionally. Reasons for not using telemedicine include the perceived difficulty with obtaining a reliable history and an inability to perform a physical examination. However, FTF consultation can cause distress and inconvenience to the child and family. In 2018, the authors' department piloted a clinical nurse specialist-led telephone consultation (TC) for follow-up appointments. This was extended to the routine neurosurgery clinics in 2020. In this study, the authors evaluate 1) the effectiveness of TC, 2) families' experience with TC compared with traditional FTF appointments, and 3) the factors associated with their preferences. METHODS: In this prospective study using a survey methodology, TCs carried out by 2 consultant neurosurgeons and 1 nurse specialist over 8 weeks were evaluated. Based on clinical background, each patient was assigned to a TC or FTF appointment. Clinical and surgical details and home postal code were recorded. At the end of each TC, the clinician recorded whether the child required an FTF appointment within 3 months. In addition, patients/families answered 1) how the current TC compared with FTF consultation, and 2) their preference of TC or FTF for the next consultation. RESULTS: A total of 114 TCs were included. No child required an FTF appointment within 3 months. Overall, compared with an FTF appointment, the TC was the ""same/better/much better"" for 101 families (89%), and ""worse/much worse"" for 13 (11%). Two-thirds of families preferred the next appointment to be a TC. Families attending a TC for new appointments preferred the next appointment to be FTF compared with those attending a follow-up TC (6/8 [75%] vs 31/106 [29%], p = 0.006). A high rating of the current TC was associated with a preference for a TC as the next appointment (p < 0.0001). Families preferring TC over FTF lived farther from the hospital (mean 38 vs 27 km) (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: From the clinicians' perspective, TC is adequate in appropriately selected patients as either the primary mode of consultation or as a triage system. From a service users' perspective, the majority of families felt that the appointment was the same/better than traditional FTF appointments. The findings suggested that 1) new patients should be offered FTF appointments; 2) follow-up TCs should be offered to families when possible; and 3) clinicians should develop their skills in conducting TCs. The authors' results have led to a modification of our algorithm in delivering traditional outpatient service and telemedicine with telephone."
Rational Design of Zika Virus Subunit Vaccine with Enhanced Efficacy,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women can lead to fetal deaths and malformations. We have previously reported that ZIKV envelope protein domain III (EDIII) is a subunit vaccine candidate with cross-neutralization activity; however, like many other subunit vaccines, its efficacy is limited. To improve the efficacy of this subunit vaccine, we identified a nonneutralizing epitope on ZIKV EDIII surrounding residue 375, which is buried in the full-length envelope protein but becomes exposed in recombinant EDIII. We then shielded this epitope with an engineered glycan probe. Compared to the wild-type EDIII, the mutant EDIII induced significantly stronger neutralizing antibodies in three mouse strains and also demonstrated significantly improved efficacy by fully protecting mice, particularly pregnant mice and their fetuses, against high-dose lethal ZIKV challenge. Moreover, the mutant EDIII immune sera significantly enhanced the passive protective efficacy by fully protecting mice against lethal ZIKV challenge; this passive protection was positively associated with neutralizing antibody titers. We further showed that the enhanced efficacy of the mutant EDIII was due to the shielding of the immunodominant nonneutralizing epitope surrounding residue 375, which led to immune refocusing on the neutralizing epitopes. Taken together, the results of this study reveal that an intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccines is their artificially exposed immunodominant nonneutralizing epitopes, which can be overcome through glycan shielding. Additionally, the mutant ZIKV protein generated in this study is a promising subunit vaccine candidate with high efficacy in preventing ZIKV infections in mice. IMPORTANCE Viral subunit vaccines generally show low efficacy. In this study, we revealed an intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccine designs: artificially exposed surfaces of subunit vaccines contain epitopes unfavorable for vaccine efficacy. More specifically, we identified an epitope on Zika virus (ZIKV) envelope protein domain III (EDIII) that is buried in the full-length envelope protein but becomes exposed in recombinant EDIII. We further shielded this epitope with a glycan, and the resulting mutant EDIII vaccine demonstrated significantly enhanced efficacy over the wild-type EDIII vaccine in protecting animal models from ZIKV infections. Therefore, the intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccines can be overcome through shielding these artificially exposed unfavorable epitopes. The engineered EDIII vaccine generated in this study is a promising vaccine candidate that can be further developed to battle ZIKV infections."
Effect of Heat inactivation on Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR of the SARS-COV-2 Detection,"Background: Real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) is commonly used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. Heat inactivation prior to nucleic acid isolation may allow safe testing, while the effects of heat inactivation on SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR detection result need to be determined. Methods: 14 positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were inactivated at 56{degrees}C for 30min, 56{degrees}C for 60min, 60{degrees}C for 30min, 60{degrees}C for 75min, and 100{degrees}C for 10min, and another 2 positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were also inactivated at 100{degrees}C for 10min, 100{degrees}C for 30min, 100{degrees}C for 60min, after which the samples were isolated and detected by rRT-PCR. Results: All 14 heat treated samples remained positive. The range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed when detecting ORF1a/b was 27.228-34.011 in heat-treated samples, while 25.281-34.861 in unheated samples, and the range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed at the time of detecting N was 25.777-33.351 in heat-treated samples, while 24.1615-35.433 in unheated samples, on basis of which it showed no statistical difference otherwise a good correlation of Ct values between the heat-inactivated samples and the untreated samples. However, the 2 samples inactivated at 100{degrees}C 30min, 100{degrees}C 60min turned into negative. Conclusions: Heat inactivation at 56{degrees}C for 30min, 56{degrees}C for 60min, 60{degrees}C for 30min, 60{degrees}C for 75min, and 100{degrees}C for 10min shall not affect the detection results of Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR of the SARS-COV2. Furthermore, it is recommended to inactive nasopharyngeal swab specimens 10min at 100{degrees}C before RNA extraction in consideration of efficiency and reliable results.

The determination of Sulfobutylether ß-Cyclodextrin Sodium (SBECD) by LC-MS/MS and its application in remdesivir pharmacokinetics study for pediatric patients,"SBECD (Captisol®) with an average degree of substitution of 6.5 sulfobutylether functional groups (SBE = 6.5), is a solubility enhancer for remdesivir (RDV) and a major component in Veklury, which was approved by FDA for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 over 12 years old and weighing over 40 kg who require hospitalization. SBECD is cleared mainly by renal filtration, thus, potential accumulation of SBECD in the human body is a concern for patients dosed with Veklury with compromised renal function. An LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for specific, accurate, and precise determination of SBECD concentrations in human plasma. In this method, the hexa-substituted species, SBE6, was selected for SBECD quantification, and the mass transition from its dicharged molecular ion [(M-2H)/2]2-, Molecular (parent) Ion (Q1)/Molecular (parent) Ion (Q3) of m/z 974.7/974.7, was selected for quantitative analysis of SBECD. Captisol-G (SBE-Î³-CD, SBE = 3) was chosen as the internal standard. With 25 µL of formic-acid-treated sample and with a calibration range of 10.0-1000 µg/mL, the method was validated with respect to pre-established criteria based on regulatory guidelines and was applied to determine SBECD levels in plasma samples collected from pediatric patients during RDV clinical studies."
Rice quality and its impacts on food security and sustainability in Bangladesh,"Rice market efficiency is important for food security in countries where rice is a staple. We assess the impact of rice quality on rice prices, food security, and environmental sustainability in Bangladesh. We find that while price varies as expected for most quality attributes, it is unaffected by a broken percentage below 24.9 percent. This reveals a potential inefficiency, considering the average 5 percent broken rate observed in the market. An increase in the broken rate of milled rice within the limits supported by our findings can, ceteris paribus, increase rice rations by 4.66 million a year, or conversely, yield the current number of rice rations using 170.79 thousand fewer hectares and cutting emissions by 1.48 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Thus, producing rice based on quality assessment can improve food security and its sustainability."

Acute myocardial infraction and pulmonary embolism in a same patient with COVID -19: a rare association,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is associated with a hypercoagulable state leading to increased incidence of thromboembolism. However, it is exceedingly rare to see presence of both arterial and venous thromboembolism simultaneously. Herein, we report an unusual presentation of a 39-year-old male with recently diagnosed COVID -19 who initially had acute myocardial infarction secondary to thrombotic occlusion of right coronary artery followed by acute pulmonary embolism. Health care providers should be aware of this uncommon yet possible co-existence of two life-threatening manifestations in order to prevent fatal consequences."

"Human coronavirus NL63, a new respiratory virus","From the mid-1960s onwards, it was believed that only two human coronavirus species infect humans: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Then, in 2003, a novel member of the coronavirus family was introduced into the human population: SARS-CoV, causing an aggressive lung disease. Fortunately, this virus was soon expelled from the human population, but it quickly became clear that the human coronavirus group contains more members then previously assumed, with HCoV-NL63 identified in 2004. Despite its recent discovery, ample results from HCoV-NL63 research have been described. We present an overview of the publications on this novel coronavirus."
Prospect of 3D Bioprinting over Cardiac Cell Therapy and Conventional Tissue Engineering in the Treatment of COVID-19 Patients with Myocardial Injury,"Due to multiple mutations of SARS-CoV-2, the mystery of defeating the virus is still unknown. Cardiovascular complications are one of the most concerning effects of COVID-19 recently, originating from direct and indirect mechanisms. These complications are associated with long-term Cardio-vascular diseases and can induce sudden cardiac death in both infected and recovered COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this research is to do a competitive analysis between conventional techniques with the upgraded alternative 3D bioprinting to replace the damaged portion of the myocardium. Additionally, this study focuses on the potential of 3D bioprinting to be a novel alternative. Finally, current challenges and future perspective of 3D bioprinting technique is briefly discussed."
EMoMiS: A Pipeline for Epitope-based Molecular Mimicry Search in Protein Structures with Applications to SARS-CoV-2,"Motivation Epitope-based molecular mimicry occurs when an antibody cross-reacts with two different antigens due to structural and chemical similarities. Molecular mimicry between proteins from two viruses can lead to beneficial cross-protection when the antibodies produced by exposure to one also react with the other. On the other hand, mimicry between a protein from a pathogen and a human protein can lead to auto-immune disorders if the antibodies resulting from exposure to the virus end up interacting with host proteins. While cross-protection can suggest the possible reuse of vaccines developed for other pathogens, cross-reaction with host proteins may explain side effects. There are no computational tools available to date for a large-scale search of antibody cross-reactivity. Results We present a comprehensive Epitope-based Molecular Mimicry Search (EMoMiS) pipeline for computational molecular mimicry searches. EMoMiS, when applied to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, identified eight examples of molecular mimicry with viral and human proteins. These findings provide possible explanations for (a) differential severity of COVID-19 caused by cross-protection due to prior vaccinations and/or exposure to other viruses, and (b) commonly seen COVID-19 side effects such as thrombocytopenia and thrombophilia. Our findings are supported by previously reported research but need validation with laboratory experiments. The developed pipeline is generic and can be applied to find mimicry for novel pathogens. It has applications in improving vaccine design. Availability The developed Epitope-based Molecular Mimicry Search Pipeline (EMoMiS) is available from https://biorg.cs.fiu.edu/emomis/.

The Environmental Impacts of the Coronavirus,"The Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic has resulted in global lockdowns, sharply curtailing economic activity. It is a unique experiment with substantial impacts that will form the agenda for research. There are five sets of questions: the short-term impacts on emissions, the natural environment and environmental policy, including regulations and COP26; longer-term consequences from the deployment of macroeconomic monetary and fiscal stimuli, and investment in green deals; possible further deglobalisation and its impact on climate change and nature; intergenerational environmental impacts including debt and pollution burdens on future generations; and possible behavioural changes to the environment, both positive and negative."

"Understanding COVID-19 via comparative analysis of dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, human SARS and bat SARS-like coronaviruses","The recently emerged coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or Wuhan coronavirus) is a causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is rapidly spreading throughout the world now. More than 1.21 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 67,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing every passing hour. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted COVID-19 as a pandemic now. Multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on SARS-CoV-2 evolution indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins contains molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein–protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners. The results of our extensive investigation of the dark side of SARS-CoV-2 proteome will have important implications in understanding the structural and non-structural biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.

"The Changing Economic Value and Leverage of Arthroplasty Surgeons: How the Shift in Arthroplasty Surgery Location Impacts the Relationship of Private Surgeons, Hospitals, and Ambulatory Surgery Centers","The recent removal of total hip and knee arthroplasty from the Medicare inpatient-only list, COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing reimbursements, and bundled payment programs have all had tremendous impact on the practice of arthroplasty. Surgeons and practices must adapt to these challenges to achieve the ideal triad of quality patient care, low cost to payors, and sustainable financial margins for stakeholders. Here, we review institutional data and present our experience with the changing arthroplasty practice landscape. With the principle of demand matching, arthroplasty surgeons and practices can risk-stratify and shuttle patients in the appropriate operative and rehabilitation setting to optimize quality and efficiency."
Evaluation of the Point-of-Care Circulating Cathodic Antigen Assay for Monitoring Mass Drug Administration in a Schistosoma mansoni Control Program in Western Kenya,"The WHO guidelines for monitoring and evaluating Schistosoma mansoni control programs are based on the Kato-Katz (KK) fecal examination method; however, there are limitations to its use, particularly in low prevalence areas. The point-of-care urine circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) assay has emerged as a useful tool for mapping schistosomiasis prevalence, but its use in monitoring and evaluating control programs has not been evaluated. Before POC-CCA can be used for these programs, it must be determined how previous guidance based on the KK method can be translated to the POC-CCA assay; furthermore, its performance in different endemicity settings must be evaluated. Urine and stool specimens were collected from students attending public primary schools in western Kenya before mass treatment with praziquantel at baseline (51 schools), year 1 (45 schools), year 2 (34 schools), and year 3 (20 schools). Prevalence and infection intensity were determined by the KK method and POC-CCA assay. Changes in prevalence and intensity were compared within the strata of schools grouped according to the baseline prevalence determined by the KK method (0–10%, > 10–20%, > 20%). The prevalence determined by the POC-CCA assay was higher than that determined by the KK method at all time points for all strata. The prevalence determined by the KK method decreased from baseline to 2 and 3 years, as did infection intensity (with one exception). A corresponding decrease was not always replicated by the POC-CCA assay results. The POC-CCA assay did not perform as expected, and the concordance of results of the two tests was poor. Furthermore, there are emerging concerns regarding the specificity of the POC-CCA assay. Therefore, it is impossible to translate historical data and programmatic guidelines based on the KK method results to the POC-CCA assay."
Handling Post-COVID-19 Sequelae: A Need for Multispecialty Approach,
Agent-based modeling and life cycle dynamics of COVID-19-related online collective actions,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly threatened global public health and produced social problems, which includes relative online collective actions. Based on the life cycle law, focusing on the life cycle process of COVID-19 online collective actions, we carried out both macro-level analysis (big data mining) and micro-level behaviors (Agent-Based Modeling) on pandemic-related online collective actions. We collected 138 related online events with macro-level big data characteristics, and used Agent-Based Modeling to capture micro-level individual behaviors of netizens. We set two kinds of movable agents, Hots (events) and Netizens (individuals), which behave smartly and autonomously. Based on multiple simulations and parametric traversal, we obtained the optimal parameter solution. Under the optimal solutions, we repeated simulations by ten times, and took the mean values as robust outcomes. Simulation outcomes well match the real big data of life cycle trends, and validity and robustness can be achieved. According to multiple criteria (spans, peaks, ratios, and distributions), the fitness between simulations and real big data has been substantially supported. Therefore, our Agent-Based Modeling well grasps the micro-level mechanisms of real-world individuals (netizens), based on which we can predict individual behaviors of netizens and big data trends of specific online events. Based on our model, it is feasible to model, calculate, and even predict evolutionary dynamics and life cycles trends of online collective actions. It facilitates public administrations and social governance."
Are RNA Viruses Candidate Agents for the Next Global Pandemic? A Review,"Pathogenic RNA viruses are potentially the most important group involved in zoonotic disease transmission, and they represent a challenge for global disease control. Their biological diversity and rapid adaptive rates have proved to be difficult to overcome and to anticipate by modern medical technology. Also, the anthropogenic change of natural ecosystems and the continuous population growth are driving increased rates of interspecies contacts and the interchange of pathogens that can develop into global pandemics. The combination of molecular, epidemiological, and ecological knowledge of RNA viruses is therefore essential towards the proper control of these emergent pathogens. This review outlines, throughout different levels of complexity, the problems posed by RNA viral diseases, covering some of the molecular mechanisms allowing them to adapt to new host species—and to novel pharmaceutical developments—up to the known ecological processes involved in zoonotic transmission."
Endothelial dysfunction and altered endothelial biomarkers in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS),"BACKGROUND: Fatigue, exertion intolerance and post-exertional malaise are among the most frequent symptoms of Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS), with a subset of patients fulfilling criteria for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). As SARS-CoV-2 infects endothelial cells, causing endotheliitis and damaging the endothelium, we investigated endothelial dysfunction (ED) and endothelial biomarkers in patients with PCS. METHODS: We studied the endothelial function in 30 PCS patients with persistent fatigue and exertion intolerance as well as in 15 age- and sex matched seronegative healthy controls (HCs). 14 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. The other patients were considered to have PCS. Peripheral endothelial function was assessed by the reactive hyperaemia index (RHI) using peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) in patients and HCs. In a larger cohort of patients and HCs, including post-COVID reconvalescents (PCHCs), Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Endocan (ESM-1), IL-8, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 were analysed as endothelial biomarkers. RESULTS: Five of the 14 post-COVID ME/CFS patients and five of the 16 PCS patients showed ED defined by a diminished RHI (< 1.67), but none of HCs exhibited this finding. A paradoxical positive correlation of RHI with age, blood pressure and BMI was found in PCS but not ME/CFS patients. The ET-1 concentration was significantly elevated in both ME/CFS and PCS patients compared to HCs and PCHCs. The serum Ang-2 concentration was lower in both PCS patients and PCHCs compared to HCs. CONCLUSION: A subset of PCS patients display evidence for ED shown by a diminished RHI and altered endothelial biomarkers. Different associations of the RHI with clinical parameters as well as varying biomarker profiles may suggest distinct pathomechanisms among patient subgroups.

What we think prayers do: Americans’ expectations and valuation of intercessory prayer,"Praying for others in the wake of a disasters is a common interpersonal and public response to tragedy in the United States. But these gestures are controversial. In a survey experiment, we elicit how people value receiving a prayer from a Christian stranger in support of a recent hardship and examine factors that affect the value of the prayer. We find that people who positively value receiving the prayer do so primarily because they believe it provides emotional support and will be answered by God. Many also value the prayer because they believe it will improve their health and wealth, although empirical support of such effects is lacking. People who negatively value receiving the prayer do so primarily because they believe praying is a waste of time. The negative value is particularly large if people are offended by religion. Finally, the hardship experienced by the prayer recipient matters to the intensity by which recipients like or dislike the gesture, suggesting the benefit of prayers varies not only across people, but also across contexts."
"Impact of COVID-19 on agricultural markets: assessing the roles of commodity characteristics, disease caseload and market reforms","This paper assesses the impact of the spread of COVID-19 and the lockdown on wholesale prices and quantities traded in agricultural markets. We compare whether these impacts differ across non-perishable (wheat) and perishable commodities (tomato and onion), and the extent to which any adverse impacts are mitigated by the adoption of a greater number of agricultural market reform measures. We use a granular data set comprising daily observations for 3 months from nearly 1000 markets across five states and use a double- and triple- difference estimation strategy. Expectedly, our results differ by type of commodity and period of analysis. While all prices spiked initially in April, they recovered relatively quickly, underscoring the importance of time duration for analysis. Wheat prices were anchored in large part by the minimum support price, while tomato prices were lower in some months. Supply constraints began easing in May with greater market arrivals perhaps reflecting distress sales. Market reform measures did help in insulating farmers from lower prices, but these effects are salient for the perishable goods, and not so much for wheat where the government remained the dominant market player. Taken together, these results point to considerable resilience in agricultural markets in dealing with the COVID-19 shock, buffered by adequate policy support."
COVID-19 and therapeutic drugs repurposing in hand: the need for collaborative efforts,"Abstract The novel pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible to cause coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). It is a global pandemic disease and has reached a new dimension with a higher death ratio. On 2 June 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) data showed more than 6,194,500 confirmed and 376,300 deaths globally due to the COVID-19. There are currently no approved medications or vaccines which have been claimed to be effective in COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Drug repurposing of available drugs and research studies for the search of new therapeutic agents are underway in various countries to try different combinations to treat their patients. It is too early to be sure of them as safe treatments because some reports seem to suggest some alarming side effects. However, a lot of work needs to be done to achieve a successful treatment result and the full safety and efficacy of the trial drugs will take some time to be developed. In this narrative perspective review, we addressed evidence-based literature on various possible antiviral medications, plant-derived antivirals drugs, and other valuable treatment options for COVID-19 management."

Effects of Mono-Vacancies of Oxygen and Manganese on the Properties of the MnO2/Graphene Heterostructure,"The effects of the monovacancies of oxygen (VO) and manganese (VMn) on the structural and electronic properties of the 1T-MnO2/graphene heterostructure are investigated, within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). We found that the values of the formation energy for the heterostructure without and with vacancies of VO and VMn were -20.99 meVÅ2&nbsp;, -32.11meVÅ2, and -20.81 meVÅ2, respectively. The negative values of the formation energy indicate that the three heterostructures are energetically stable and that they could be grown in the experiment (exothermic processes). Additionally, it was found that the presence of monovacancies of VO and VMn in the heterostructure induce: (a) a slight decrease in the interlayer separation distance in the 1T-MnO2/graphene heterostructure of ~0.13% and ~1.41%, respectively, and (b) a contraction of the (Mn-O) bond length of the neighboring atoms of the VO and VMn monovacancies of ~2.34% and ~6.83%, respectively. Calculations of the Bader charge for the heterostructure without and with VO and VMn monovacancies show that these monovacancies induce significant changes in the charge of the first-neighbor atoms of the VO and VMn vacancies, generating chemically active sites (locales) that could favor the adsorption of external atoms and molecules. From the analysis of the density of state and the structure of the bands, we found that the graphene conserves the Dirac cone in the heterostructure with or without vacancies, while the 1T-MnO2 monolayer in the heterostructures without and with VO monovacancies exhibits half-metallic and magnetic behavior. These properties mainly come from the hybridization of the 3d-Mn and 2p-O states. In both cases, the heterostructure possesses a magnetic moment of 3.00 µß/Mn. From this behavior, it can be inferred the heterostructures with and without VO monovacancies could be used in spintronics."
False-Positive Axillary Lymph Nodes on FDG PET/CT Resulting From COVID-19 Immunization,"World-wide mass COVID-19 vaccination has been deployed starting with those most vulnerable, including the elderly and cancer patients. A 70-year-old man with right lung cancer underwent staging FDG PET/CT, which demonstrated an avid right lung mass with avid hilar and mediastinal nodes. Avid left axillary nodes of benign configuration were also noted. The patient had the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination in the left arm a week earlier. On reflection, the axillary nodes were concluded to be reactive related to this. This is a potential COVID-19 vaccination associated pitfall on PET/CT that should be considered when interpreting FDG PET/CT images."
"Association Between Psychological Distress, Cognitive Complaints, and Neuropsychological Status After a Severe COVID-19 Episode: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background: Cognitive complaints are frequent after COVID-19 but their clinical determinants are poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the associations of objective cognitive performances and psychological distress with cognitive complaints in COVID-19 survivors. Materials and Methods: Patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19 in a university hospital during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in France were followed-up at 1 month after their admission. Cognitive complaints were self-reported and standardized instruments were used to assess neuropsychological status (Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Semantic Verbal Fluency Test, Mini Mental Status Examination) and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS). Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, sex, admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and need for oxygen and C-reactive protein. Results: One hundred patients (34% women, median age: 60 years [interquartile range: 49–72)] completed the neuropsychological assessment at follow-up. In multivariable analyses, cognitive complaints at 1-month were associated with greater HADS score (OR for one interquartile range: OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.08–3.57) and older age (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.09) and, negatively, with admission in ICU (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05–0.90). In contrast, none of the objective neuropsychological test scores was significantly associated with cognitive complaints. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive complaints were associated with both anxiety and depressive symptoms. Discussion: These preliminary results suggest that cognitive complaints at 1 month after a hospitalization for COVID-19 are associated with psychological distress, independently of objective neuropsychological status. Anxiety and depression symptoms should be systematically screened in patients presenting with cognitive complaints after a severe COVID-19 episode."

Among several physiological, behavioral, clinical and biochemical traits, serum cortisol (SC) and creatine kinase (CK) levels, as well as feed consumption can be used as valid indicators of potential stressful and fatiguing conditions and, therefore, can be efficiently used for stress analysis studies. Hence, the objective of the study was to assess the fly-repellency effect of deltamethrin on pre-weaned dairy calves exposed to heat stress conditions, as well as its association with SC, CK concentrations and feed consumption. Two commercial dairy cattle herds of the Holstein breed in Central Macedonia (Greece) were involved in the study during summer months and under heat stress conditions. Deltamethrin administration resulted in (i) a decreased fly population (100% Musca domestica) landing on pre-weaned dairy calves, (ii) a reduced SC (stress indicator) and CK (fatigue indicator) concentration, and (iii) an increased consumption of feedstuff in deltamethrin treated animals compared to the untreated ones."
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the catastrophic costs incurred by tuberculosis patients,"One of the strategies of the World Health Organization End Tuberculosis (TB) was to reduce the catastrophic costs incurred by TB-affected families to 0% by 2020.Catastrophic cost is defined by the total cost related to TB management exceeding 20% of the annual pre-TB household income. This study aimed to estimate the pooled proportion of TB affected households who incurred catastrophic costs. We searched PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, ProQuest, SAGE, and Web of Science databases according to Preferred Reporting Items of the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines till November 20, 2020. Eligible studies were identified and data on catastrophic costs due to TB were extracted. We performed a meta-analysis to generate the pooled proportion of patients with TB facing catastrophic costs. From 5114 studies identified, 29 articles were included in the final analysis. The pooled proportion of patients faced catastrophic costs was (43%, 95% CI [34–51]). Meta-regression revealed that country, drug sensitivity, and Human immune-deficiency Virus (HIV) co-infection were the main predictors of such costs. Catastrophic costs incurred by drug sensitive, drug resistant, and HIV co-infection were 32%, 81%, and 81%, respectively. The catastrophic costs incurred were lower among active than passive case findings (12% vs. 30%). Half (50%) of TB-affected households faced catastrophic health expenditure at 10% cut-off point. The financial burden of patients seeking TB diagnosis and treatment continues to be a worldwide impediment. Therefore, the End TB approach should rely on socioeconomic support and cost-cutting initiatives. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020221283."
Timing and Persistence of Material Hardship Among Children in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: Screening for social determinants of health (SDH) has been widely adopted to identify child health risks associated with exposure to material hardship. Whereas SDH screening typically addresses a 12-month span, we sought to compare the prevalence of exposure to present (within the past year) as compared to recent (2–4 years ago) hardship among children in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed the 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation, a nationally representative survey that interviewed participating households annually between 2014 and 2017. We included data from households with children in all waves. As of 2017, households were categorized as (1) experiencing present hardship (within the last year); (2) experiencing recent but not present hardship (any year between 2014 and 2016); and (3) experiencing no hardship over the 4-year period. RESULTS: Of 2422 households, 27% experienced present hardship and 29% experienced recent but not present hardship. Households presently experiencing hardship were more likely to have Medicaid insurance, less likely to be married, and had more children than families who had experienced recent hardship. However, these groups were similar on caregivers’ educational attainment, race/ethnicity, language spoken in the home, and age of the youngest child. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that clinical screening tools for SDH that use a 12-month time frame risk missing many children who have recently (within the past 4 years) experienced material hardship and may benefit from interventions to improve social support; a longer time frame could provide clinicians with valuable information for understanding social factors that impact child health and development."
Determinants of uptake of a third dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,
A herbal formula for prevention of influenza-like syndrome: A double-blind randomized clinical trial,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of a herbal formula in the prevention of influenza or influenza-like syndrome among elderies residing in old-people’s home in Hong Kong. The secondary objectives are to investigate the quality of life (QOL) and symptomology changes among the herbal users and to evaluate the safety of this formula. METHODS: In ten old people’s home or community centres in New Territories, Hong Kong, 740 eligible subjects agreed to join the study and were randomized to receive a herbal formula or a placebo on alternate days over 8 weeks. Among those 740 participants, 113 had provided blood samples for immunological assessments before and after the study drug. Assessments were done at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Participants were instructed to keep a daily record of body temperature and any symptoms as sore throat, myalgia, running nose or cough, and to report to assessor accordingly. Those reporting body temperature of 37.8 °C and above would be visited and a proper nasopharyngeal swab be taken for viral study. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants developed influenza-like-symptoms but none of them was proven influenza in their nasopharyngeal swabs, 40 of these patients belonged to the herbal group and 32 to the placebo group, without significant differences between groups. The difference on the changes in QOL between the two groups was not statistically significant. However, in the immunological study, the natural killer cell absolute count was significantly increased in the herbal group compared with the placebo group (463±253 vs 413±198, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The herbal preparation was not effective compared with placebo in the prevention of influenza-like syndrome. It was however safe and possibly supporting immunological responses."
"Pharmacokinetic study of luteolin, apigenin, chrysoeriol and diosmetin after oral administration of Flos Chrysanthemi extract in rats","Flos Chrysanthemi (the flower of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) is widely used in China as a food and traditional Chinese medicine for many diseases. Luteolin and apigenin are two main bioactive components in Flos Chrysanthemi, and chrysoeriol and diosmetin are two methylated metabolites of luteolin in vivo by cathechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). However, there was lack of pharmacokinetic information of chrysoeriol and diosmetin after oral administration of Flos Chrysanthemi extract (FCE). The present study aimed to develop an HPLC-UV method for simultaneous determination of rat plasma concentration of luteolin, apigenin, chrysoeriol and diosmetin and utilize it in pharmacokinetic study of the four compounds after orally giving FCE to rats. The method was successfully validated and applied to the pharmacokinetic study when oral administration of FCE to rats with or without co-giving a COMT inhibitor, entacapone. Chrysoeriol and diosmetin were detected in rat plasma after oral administration of FCE and their concentrations were significantly decreased after co-giving entacapone. Furthermore, AUC of luteolin was significantly increased by entacapone, while that of chrysoeriol was decreased by entacapone, which revealed COMT might play an important role in the disposition of luteolin in rats after dosing of FCE. In conclusion, a sensitive, accurate and reproducible HPLC-UV method for simultaneous determination of luteolin, apigenin, chrysoeriol and diosmetin in rat plasma were developed, pharmacokinetics of chrysoeriol and diosmetin combined with luteolin and apigenin were characterized after oral administration of FCE to rats, which gave us more information on pharmacokinetics and potential pharmacological effects of FCE in vivo."
Global Comparison of Changes in the Number of Test-Positive Cases and Deaths by Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19) in the World,"Global differences in changes in the numbers of population-adjusted daily test-positive cases (NPDP) and deaths (NPDD) by COVID-19 were analyzed for 49 countries, including developed and developing countries. The changes as a proportion of national population were compared, adjusting by the beginning of test-positive cases increase (BPI) or deaths increase (BDI). Remarkable regional differences of more than 100-fold in NPDP and NPDD were observed. The trajectories of NPDD after BDI increased exponentially within 20 days in most countries. Machine learning analysis suggested that NPDD on 30 days after BDI was the highest in developed Western countries (1180 persons per hundred million), followed by countries in the Middle East (128), Latin America (97), and Asia (7). Furthermore, in Western countries with positive rates of the PCR test of less than 7.0%, the increase in NPDP was slowing-down two weeks after BPI, and subsequent NPDD was only 15% compared with those with higher positive rates, which suggested that the situation of testing might have affected the velocity of COVID-19 spread. The causes behind remarkable differences between regions possibly include genetic factors of inhabitants because distributions of the race and of the observed infection increasing rates were in good agreement globally."
COVID-19-Induced Hypoxia With Accompanying Syncope Event and Traumatic Injury,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the first case of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on January 21, 2020 in the United States. Since its arrival, the virus has caused widespread havoc on the nation as a whole as well as on all individuals. The coronavirus family is not new to the field of medicine. In fact, the viral pathogenicity dates back to the early 1960s, with more information on the respiratory preference and the ability to cause acute respiratory pathology coming later in 2002. The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, causes a disease commonly referred to as COVID-19, which has a well documented course of severe respiratory pathology along with interesting systemic consequences that often complicate the clinical picture. This case presents an otherwise healthy young 35-year-old male who contracted the novel coronavirus, leading to multi-organ hypoxia and triggering a syncopal episode which resulted in physical trauma to the head leading to a minor subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Galectins and Their Ligand Glycoconjugates in the Central Nervous System Under Physiological and Pathological Conditions,"Galectins are ß-galactoside-binding lectins consisting of 15 members in mammals. Galectin-1,-3,-4,-8, and -9 are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and regulate various physiological and pathological events. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the cellular expression and role of galectins in the CNS, and discusses their functions in neurite outgrowth, myelination, and neural stem/progenitor cell niches, as well as in ischemic/hypoxic/traumatic injuries and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Galectins are expressed in both neurons and glial cells. Galectin-1 is mainly expressed in motoneurons, whereas galectin-3-positive neurons are broadly distributed throughout the brain, especially in the hypothalamus, indicating its function in the regulation of homeostasis, stress response, and the endocrine/autonomic system. Astrocytes predominantly contain galectin-1, and galectin-3 and-9 are upregulated along with its activation. Activated, but not resting, microglia contain galectin-3, supporting its phagocytic activity. Galectin-1,-3, and -4 are characteristically expressed during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Galectin-3 from microglia promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, while galectin-1 and axonal galectin-4 suppress its differentiation and myelination. Galectin-1- and- 3-positive cells are involved in neural stem cell niche formation in the subventricular zone and hippocampal dentate gyrus, and the migration of newly generated neurons and glial cells to the olfactory bulb or damaged lesions. In neurodegenerative diseases, galectin-1,-8, and -9 have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. Galectin-3 facilitates pro-inflammatory action; however, it also plays an important role during the recovery period. Several ligand glycoconjugates have been identified so far such as laminin, integrins, neural cell adhesion molecule L1, sulfatide, neuropilin-1/plexinA4 receptor complex, triggering receptor on myeloid cells 2, and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain. N-glycan branching on lymphocytes and oligodendroglial progenitors mediated by ß1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5/GnTV) influences galectin-binding, modulating inflammatory responses and remyelination in neurodegenerative diseases. De-sulfated galactosaminoglycans such as keratan sulfate are potential ligands for galectins, especially galectin-3, regulating neural regeneration. Galectins have multitudinous functions depending on cell type and context as well as post-translational modifications, including oxidization, phosphorylation, S-nitrosylation, and cleavage, but there should be certain rules in the expression patterns of galectins and their ligand glycoconjugates, possibly related to glucose metabolism in cells."
Emerging virus diseases: can we ever expect the unexpected?,"Emerging virus diseases are a major threat to human and veterinary public health. With new examples occurring approximately one each year, the majority are viruses originating from an animal host. Of the many factors responsible, changes to local ecosystems that perturb the balance between pathogen and principal host species is one of the major drivers, together with increasing urbanization of mankind and changes in human behavior. Many emerging viruses have RNA genomes and as such are capable of rapid mutation and selection of new variants in the face of environmental changes in host numbers and available target species. This review summarizes recent work on aspects of virus emergence and the current understanding of the molecular and immunological basis whereby viruses may cross between species and become established in new ecological niches. Emergence is hard to predict, although mathematical modeling and spatial epidemiology have done much to improve the prediction of where emergence may occur. However, much needs to be done to ensure adequate surveillance is maintained of animal species known to present the greatest risk thus increasing general alertness among physicians, veterinarians and those responsible for formulating public health policy."
"Perinatal Outcomes During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ontario, Canada","This cohort study evaluates rates of preterm birth and stillbirth in Ontario, Canada, during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Pharmacist-directed Sputnik V (GAM-COVID-VAC) surveillance program: a prospective observational study in Southern India,"OBJECTIVES: The study underwent to evaluate the adverse events, the incidence of COVID-19 and the participant's attitude and perception towards the vaccine following Sputnik V administration through an active surveillance program. METHODS: The prospective observational study was conducted four months in the Sputnik V vaccination center that enrolled 700 participants. Sociodemographic details, medical histories, COVID-19 incidences and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) of each sample were collected through face-to-face interviews and a telephonic feedback system. A self-prepared and validated questionnaire addressed their acceptances and perceptions towards the vaccination drive. RESULTS: Our study reported 42.1% of AEFIs after the first dose and 9.1% after the second. Fever, pain at the injection site, body pain, headache and fatigue were predominant, while dizziness and diarrhoea were rare. However, AEFIs were not influenced by the presence of comorbidities (p > 0.05). On the other hand, there were limited post immunization (1.8%) COVID-19 patients and that too with minor severity (p < 0.01). Our participants were overall satisfied with the Sputnik V immunization. However, those presented with AEFIs on the consecutive three days depicted slightly declined gratification (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pharmacist-directed surveillance program on Sputnik V showed fewer events of AEFIs and negligible occurrence of COVID19 following immunization. Moreover, the population had appreciable attitude and positive perceptions towards Sputnik V vaccination."
Recommendations for ‘responsible behaviour’ is not a sufficient policy tool in public health emergencies,
"Global scenario, public health concerns and mitigation strategies to counter current ongoing SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 pandemic","Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus- 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has posed a great public health threat to the global community as a pandemic. The origin of the virus has been linked to animals, through a yet-to-be-identified intermediate host. The disease is transmitted to humans mainly through inhalation or contact with infected droplets. The variable clinical presentation of COVID-19 includes fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue and malaise; however, cutaneous, ocular, neurological, and gastrointestinal manifestations have also been reported. There is an urgent need to strengthen One Health surveillance, intervention, and management strategies to understand the ecology of coronaviruses and to prevent epidemics in the future. Global attention toward the development of treatments, immunotherapies, vaccines, and control options to combat the COVID-19 pandemic has been on an increasing trend. Here, we review the current epidemiological status, public health concerns, and mitigation strategies for COVID-19."
Towards Covid-19 Literacy: Investigating the Literacy Levels of University Students in Colombia,"Covid-19 literacy, induced by the coronavirus disease (2019), is characterized as the understanding of Covid-19 as well as informed decisions based upon this understanding. This type of literacy is closely related to health literacy, scientific literacy, and scientific media literacy. It may be obvious to say that Covid-19 literacy is a key factor for governments to effectively manage the Covid-19 transition. However, lack of literature exists about Covid-19 literacy among university students. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the Covid-19 literacy level among 4168 students from a Colombian university. The data were derived from students’ responses to a 25–item anonymous online self-reporting questionnaire. We found that 21–25-year age group, graduate students, students enrolled prior to 2015, and medical students had a significantly higher mean score. Moreover, the Internet (86.8%) was the most popular source of information from which participants gained most information regarding Covid-19. Furthermore, 58.5% of the participants considered health workers as a source that can provide accurate information. Most importantly, the findings reveal the students’ knowledge about (1) the role of an eventual process of vaccination, (2) the test currently used as diagnostic for Covid-19, and (3) the fatality rate, three aspects of Covid-19 literacy that deserve more attention. The findings provide a useful basis for the formulation of policies and concrete actions in improving Covid-19 literacy."
Changes in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with severe COVID-19 treated with high dose of vitamin D,"Main cause of severe illness and death in COVID-19 patients appears to be an excessive but ineffectual inflammatory immune response that may cause severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Vitamin D may favour an anti-inflammatory environment and improve cytotoxic response against some infectious diseases. A multicenter, single-blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial was approved in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) of 14.8 ng/mL (SD: 6.18) to test antiviral efficacy, tolerance and safety of 10,000 IU/day of cholecalciferol (vitamin D(3)) for 14 days, in comparison with 2,000 IU/day. After supplementation, mean serum 25(OH)D levels increased to 19 ng/mL on average in 2,000 IU/day versus 29 ng/mL in 10,000 IU/day group (p <0.0001). Although levels of inflammatory cytokines were not modified by treatment with 10,000 IU/day, there was an increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and higher levels of CD4+ T cells, with predominance of T central memory subpopulation. Cytotoxic response against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infected cells was increased more than 4-fold in patients who received 10,000 IU/day. Moreover, levels of IFNγ were significantly higher in this group. Beneficial effect of supplementation with 10,000 IU/day was also observed in participants who developed ARDS and stayed at the hospital for 8.0 days, whereas those who received 2,000 IU/day stayed for 29.2 days (p=0.0381). Administration of high doses of vitamin D(3) as adjuvant of the standard care treatment during hospitalization for COVID-19 may improve the inflammatory environment and cytotoxic response against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, shortening the hospital stay and, possibly, improving the prognosis."
Wearable Sensors for Remote Health Monitoring: Potential Applications for Early Diagnosis of Covid‐19,"Wearable sensors are emerging as a new technology to detect physiological and biochemical markers for remote health monitoring. By measuring vital signs such as respiratory rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen level, wearable sensors offer tremendous potential for the noninvasive and early diagnosis of numerous diseases such as Covid‐19. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made to develop wearable sensors with high sensitivity, accuracy, flexibility, and stretchability, bringing to reality a new paradigm of remote health monitoring. In this review paper, the latest advances in wearable sensor systems that can measure vital signs at an accuracy level matching those of point‐of‐care tests are presented. In particular, the focus of this review is placed on wearable sensors for measuring respiratory behavior, body temperature, and blood oxygen level, which are identified as the critical signals for diagnosing and monitoring Covid‐19. Various designs based on different materials and working mechanisms are summarized. This review is concluded by identifying the remaining challenges and future opportunities for this emerging field."
Bivalirudin for Maintenance Anticoagulation During Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for COVID-19,"In its severe manifestation, COVID-19 compromises oxygenation in a manner that is refractory to maximal conventional support and requires escalation to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Maintaining ECMO support for extended durations requires a delicately balanced anticoagulation strategy to maintain circuit viability by preventing thrombus deposition, while avoiding excessive anticoagulation yielding hemorrhage; a task that is complicated in COVID-19 secondary to an inherent hypercoagulable state. Bivalirudin, a member of the direct thrombin inhibitor drug class, offers potential advantages during ECMO including to its ability to exert its effect by directly attaching to and inhibiting freely circulating and fibrin-bound thrombin. Herein, we report the successful use of an anticoagulation strategy employing the off-label use of a continuous infusion of bivalirudin in a case of severe hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 requiring VV-ECMO. Importantly, therapeutic anticoagulation intensity was rapidly achieved with stable pharmacokinetics and there was no need for any circuit interventions throughout the patient's 27 day ECMO course. In COVID-19, bivalirudin offers a potential option for maintaining systemic anticoagulation during ECMO in a manner that may mitigate the pro-thrombotic nature of the underlying pathophysiologic state."
Functional genomics and metabolomics advance the ethnobotany of the Samoan traditional medicine “matalafi”,"The leaf homogenate of Psychotria insularum is widely used in Samoan traditional medicine to treat inflammation associated with fever, body aches, swellings, wounds, elephantiasis, incontinence, skin infections, vomiting, respiratory infections, and abdominal distress. However, the bioactive components and underlying mechanisms of action are unknown. We used chemical genomic analyses in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) to identify and characterize an iron homeostasis mechanism of action in the traditional medicine as an unfractionated entity to emulate its traditional use. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the homogenate identified two flavonol glycosides, rutin and nicotiflorin, each binding iron in an ion-dependent molecular networking metabolomics analysis. Translating results to mammalian immune cells and traditional application, the iron chelator activity of the P. insularum homogenate or rutin decreased proinflammatory and enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in immune cells. Together, the synergistic power of combining traditional knowledge with chemical genomics, metabolomics, and bioassay-guided fractionation provided molecular insight into a relatively understudied Samoan traditional medicine and developed methodology to advance ethnobotany."
Investigating Diseases and Chemicals in COVID-19 Literature with Text Mining,"Given the rapidly unfolding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to streamline the literature synthesis of the growing scientific research to elucidate targeted solutions. Traditional systematic literature review studies have restrictions, including analyzing a limited number of papers, having various biases, being time-consuming and labor-intensive, focusing on a few topics, and lack of data-driven tools. This research has collected 9,298 papers representing COVID-19 research published through May 5, 2020. We used frequency analysis to find highly frequent manifestations and therapeutic chemicals, representing the importance of the two biomedical concepts. This study also applied topic modeling that provided 25 categories showing associations between the two overarching categories. This study is beneficial to researchers for obtaining a macro-level picture of literature, to educators for knowing the scope of literature, and to policymakers and funding agencies for creating scientific strategic plans regarding COVID-19."
Defining Facets of Social Distancing during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Twitter Analysis,"Social distancing has been one of the primary mitigation strategies in the United States to control the spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and can be viewed as a multi-faceted public health measure. Using Twitter data, we aim to (1) define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of facets of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US in a spatiotemporal context and (2) examine the most amplified tweets among social distancing facets. We analyzed a total of 259,529 unique tweets containing ""coronavirus"" from 115,485 unique users between January 23, 2020 and March 24, 2020 that were identified by the Twitter API as English and U.S.-based. Tweets containing specified keywords (determined a priori) were grouped into six social distancing facets: implementation, purpose, social disruption, adaptation, positive emotions, and negative emotions. Tweets about social disruptiveness were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited. Social distancing tweets became overall more prevalent in the U.S. from late January to March but were not geographically uniform. In January and February, facets of social distancing appeared in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, which were among the first cities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tweets related to the ""implementation"" and ""negative emotions"" facets of social distancing largely dominated in combination with topics of ""social disruption"" and ""adaptation"", albeit to a lesser degree. Social distancing can be defined in terms of facets that respond and represent certain moments and events in a pandemic, including travel restrictions and rising COVID-19 case counts. For example, in February, Miami, FL had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in March which corresponded with the rise of COVID-19 cases in the city. This suggests that overall volume of social distancing tweets can reflect the relative case count in respective locations."

"Efectividad de la acupuntura y la auriculoterapia para reducir el nivel de depresión, ansiedad y estrés en personal sanitario de urgencias durante la pandemia de COVID-19","Objective To analyze the effectiveness of an intervention using acupuncture and auriculotherapy for the clinical reduction of symptoms of stress and anxiety in healthcare personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design Prospective study comparing 2 cohorts. Setting Emergency Room of the Hospital de Palamós, Girona. Participants Health workers from the emergency service. A total of 22 professionals participated, 11 in each group. Interventions The short version of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) was performed on all participants, the intervention group (IG) also received 6 sessions of acupuncture and auriculotherapy. Subsequently, the DASS-21 scale was repeated. Measurements The variables were group, sex, age, professional category, years of experience in the emergency room, DASS-21 scale with its subscales for stress, anxiety and depression. Results A 45.4% of the professionals suffered stress, 40.9% anxiety and 27.2% depression. There is a reduction of stress by 90,9% in the IG vs 18.2% in the control group (CG), this being statistically significant. There is an anxiety reduction in 81.8% of the IG vs 63.6% of the CG: p = 0.065; odds ratio: 2.57 (95% confidence interval, 0.36–18.33). The mean anxiety of the IG is statistically lower in the post-intervention value than in the pre-intervention value (1.36 vs 3.90; p = 0.003), while in the CG (3.09 vs 2.45; p = 0.208). There is a reduction in the level of depression in 81.8% of the IG vs 45.5% of the CG (p = 0.183). Conclusions Acupuncture is a treatment that improves stress and anxiety levels in healthcare professionals against COVID-19."
COVID-19 and Thyroid: Progress and Prospects,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread worldwide. A number of serious effects on various organs and systems have been reported in humans, and recently emerging evidence on the potential association between the infection and thyroid dysfunction are attracting attention from the scientific community. This editorial critically summarizes the main findings on this topic published so far and defines research lines according to the translational approach from the bench to the bed to epidemiological studies and back again, aimed at patient care and effective public health measures."
Multi-omics insights into host-viral response and pathogenesis in Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses for novel therapeutic target,"The pathogenesis and host-viral interactions of the Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV) are convoluted and not well evaluated. Application of the multi-omics system biology approaches, including biological network analysis in elucidating the complex host-viral response, interrogates the viral pathogenesis. The present study aimed to fingerprint the system-level alterations during acute CCHFV-infection and the cellular immune responses during productive CCHFV-replication in vitro. We used system-wide network-based system biology analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a longitudinal cohort of CCHF patients during the acute phase of infection and after one year of recovery (convalescent phase) followed by untargeted quantitative proteomics analysis of the most permissive CCHFV-infected Huh7 and SW13 cells. In the RNAseq analysis of the PBMCs, comparing the acute and convalescent-phase, we observed system-level host’s metabolic reprogramming towards central carbon and energy metabolism (CCEM) with distinct upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during CCHFV-infection. Upon application of network-based system biology methods, negative coordination of the biological signaling systems like FOXO/Notch axis and Akt/mTOR/HIF-1 signaling with metabolic pathways during CCHFV-infection were observed. The temporal quantitative proteomics in Huh7 showed a dynamic change in the CCEM over time and concordant with the cross-sectional proteomics in SW13 cells. By blocking the two key CCEM pathways, glycolysis and glutaminolysis, viral replication was inhibited in vitro. Activation of key interferon stimulating genes during infection suggested the role of type I and II interferon-mediated antiviral mechanisms both at the system level and during progressive replication."
Incorporating Human Movement Data to Improve Epidemiological Estimates for 2019-nCoV,"Estimating the key epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic proves to be challenging, given incompleteness and delays in early data reporting, in particular, the severe under-reporting bias in the epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts."
Re-imagining environmental governance: Gold dredge mining vs Territorial Health in the Colombian Amazon,"This article describes and analyses an encounter in the Colombian Amazon between Indigenous practices and arrangements to manage their environment and the conservation policies of the State. Indigenous peoples understand their world as populated by powerful human and nonhuman beings; for them, the moral duty of achieving happiness and abundance for all implies sustaining reciprocal and respectful relations with these beings (including the State). In contrast Colombian environmental policy distinguishes between nature and culture, seeking to safeguard landscapes from human interference so that natural processes can unfold unhindered. In practice these partially connected, yet incommensurable worldviews make for a ‘perfect storm’ - opening opportunities for illegal mining. Drawing on recent fieldwork among the Andoke, an ethnic group well acquainted with extractivism in its different historical modalities and presently affronting the fallout of gold dredge mining we narrate how a parallel, non-state governance system makes it difficult for them to care for their land and entertain mutual and respectful relations with human and nonhuman beings (which we translate as ‘territorial health’). We conclude by arguing for the need to re-imagine environmental governance in ways that more closely engage with what we call pluriversal governance: a form of (environmental) governance that does ontological justice to those involved in the environmental conflict – including, crucially, Indigenous people."
Effects of Medical Face Masks on Physical Performance in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease or Hypertension.,"In this randomized, prospective monocentric study, 40 subjects with coronary artery disease or hypertension (cardiovascular disease [CVD] group) were assigned to either surgical mask (SM) or class 2 filtering facepiece mask (FFP2). They performed cycle ergometry exercise tests with progressive intensity until exhaustion with the assigned mask and another test with no mask (NM) in random order. A control group of 10 healthy subjects randomly performed 3 exercise tests with NM, SM, and FFP2, respectively. Blood pressure, heart rate, 12-lead electrocardiogram, exertion, shortness of breath, and capillary blood gases from the earlobe were documented. Across all groups, exercise testing with face masks resulted in a significantly reduced peak power output in watts compared with testing with NM (CVD group: SM vs NM: -5.0 ± 7.0%, p = 0.005; FFP2 vs NM: -4.7 ± 14%, p = 0.03; control group: SM vs NM: -6.8 ± 4.4%, p = 0.008; FFP2 vs NM: -8.9 ± 6.3%; p = 0.01) without differences in hemodynamic parameters, such as maximum heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Wearing an FFP2 compared with NM resulted in significant higher carbon dioxide partial pressure (CVD group: FFP2: 36.0 ± 3.2 mm Hg vs NM: 33.3 ± 4.4 mm Hg, p = 0.019; control group: FFP2: 32.6 ± 2.8 mm Hg vs NM: 28.1 ± 1.7 mm Hg, p <0.001) with corresponding differences in hydrogen carbonate and base excess, but not to a clinically critical extent. In conclusion, exercise testing with SM and FFP2 resulted in a significant reduction of peak power output without differences in hemodynamic parameters in subjects with preexisting CVD and in healthy subjects."
"Enhancing early detection of neurological and developmental disorders and provision of intervention in low-resource settings in Uttar Pradesh, India: study protocol of the G.A.N.E.S.H. programme","INTRODUCTION: Around 9% of India’s children under six are diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders. Low-resource, rural communities often lack programmes for early identification and intervention. The Prechtl General Movement Assessment (GMA) is regarded as the best clinical tool to predict cerebral palsy in infants <5 months. In addition, children with developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, late detected genetic disorders or autism spectrum disorder show abnormal general movements (GMs) during infancy. General Movement Assessment in Neonates for Early Identification and Intervention, Social Support and Health Awareness (G.A.N.E.S.H.) aims to (1) provide evidence as to whether community health workers can support the identification of infants at high-risk for neurological and developmental disorders and disabilities, (2) monitor further development in those infants and (3) initiate early and targeted intervention procedures. METHODS: This 3-year observational cohort study will comprise at least 2000 infants born across four districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Community health workers, certified for GMA, video record and assess the infants’ GMs twice, that is, within 2 months after birth and at 3–5 months. In case of abnormal GMs and/or reduced MOSs, infants are further examined by a paediatrician and a neurologist. If necessary, early intervention strategies (treatment as usual) are introduced. After paediatric and neurodevelopmental assessments at 12–24 months, outcomes are categorised as normal or neurological/developmental disorders. Research objective (1): to relate the GMA to the outcome at 12–24 months. Research objective (2): to investigate the impact of predefined exposures. Research objective (3): to evaluate the interscorer agreement of GMA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: G.A.N.E.S.H. received ethics approval from the Indian Government Chief Medical Officers of Varanasi and Mirzapur and from the Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service in Varanasi. GMA is a worldwide used diagnostic tool, approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Graz, Austria (27-388 ex 14/15). Apart from peer-reviewed publications, we are planning to deploy G.A.N.E.S.H. in other vulnerable settings."
Multimonth Dispensing of Antiretroviral Therapy Protects the Most Vulnerable From 2 Pandemics at Once,We encourage governments in countries that have a high prevalence of people living with HIV to implement multimonth dispensing of antiretroviral therapy to safeguard both patients with HIV and health care workers from coronavirus disease 2019.
Endoscopic full-thickness dissection (EFTD) in the rectum: a case series.,"BACKGROUND Rectal endoscopic full- thickness dissection (EFTD) using a flexible colonoscope is an alternative to the well-established trans-anal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and the trans-anal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) techniques for resecting dysplastic or malignant rectal lesions. This study evaluated EFTD safety by analyzing outcomes of the first patients to undergo rectal EFTD at the University Hospital of North-Norway. METHODS The first 10 patients to undergo rectal EFTD at the University Hospital of North-Norway April, 2016 and January, 2021, were included in the study. The procedural indications for EFTD were therapeutic resection of non-lifting adenoma, T1 adenocarcinoma (AC), recurrent neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and re-excision of a T1-2 AC. RESULTS EFTD rectal specimen histopathology revealed three ACs, five adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (HGD), one NET and one benign lesion. Six procedures had negative lateral and vertical resection margins and in three cases lateral margins could not be evaluated due to piece-meal dissection or heat damaged tissue. Two patients experienced delayed post-procedural hemorrhage, one of whom also presented with a concurrent post-procedural infection. No serious complications occurred. CONCLUSION Preliminary results from this introductory trial indicate that EFTD in the rectum can be conducted with satisfactory perioperative results and low risk of serious complications."
Factors influencing breastfeeding practices in China: A meta‐aggregation of qualitative studies,"The World Health Organization recommends that women exclusively breastfeed until their babies are 6 months old and continue to breastfeed while introducing complementary foods. A meta‐aggregation methodology was used to systematically review and synthesise the qualitative studies on factors influencing breastfeeding practices of healthy Chinese women in Greater China. English and Chinese databases were searched to identify peer‐reviewed qualitative studies (published 2008–2019). Relevant data were extracted, and key themes related to factors influencing breastfeeding practices were identified. Of 7587 articles identified, 22 qualitative studies met inclusion criteria for the review, 10 of which were published in Chinese. A total of 87 themes were extracted from all included studies and classified into 9 subcategories: government enactment of policies, implementation of policies in workplaces, social expectations, social support, medical and health services, services with Chinese characteristics, breastfeeding and pumping facilities, maternal perceptions of breastfeeding and self‐efficacy to breastfeed. The nine subcategories were then grouped into four categories. Potential effect associations among these influence factors of breastfeeding practices emerged from categories and subcategories. Family members' influence on breastfeeding motivation and self‐efficacy suggest a potential benefit of breastfeeding promotion interventions targeting the whole family. The role of primary care should be fully exploited in breastfeeding promotion, including both prenatal education and post‐partum visits. Standardising the training and qualifications of maternity matrons (yuesao) and folk breastfeeding specialists (cuirushi) can promote evidence‐based approaches to facilitating breastfeeding during the confinement period. Increased availability of breastfeeding and pumping facilities in the workplace would facilitate continuing breastfeeding after returning to work."
Oncolytic effect of SARS-CoV2 in a patient with NK lymphoma,"Covid-19 infection was a possible causal factor in the exhaustion and decrease number of NK clonal cells, resulting in a evident improvement of signs, symptoms and clinical features related to NK lymphoma refractory to previous immuno-chemiotherapy. It has been shown that SARS-CoV2 binds to ACE2. Covid-19 may infect NK cells to suppress their functions, as NK cells express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines in Covid-19 infection may have played a crucial role in lymphodepletion. Although not published in Covid-19, other RNA viruses that cause acute pulmonary infections promote NK cell apoptosis. In NK/T-cell lymphoma plasma EBV-DNA is a sensitive surrogate biomarker of lymphoma load. In this case, we also notice a dramatic transient reduction in plasmatic EBV-DNA viral copies during Covid-19 pneumonia other than NK clonal cells reduction, and after the infection resolution we described a lymphoma relapse as well as EBV-DNA increase and the rising in NK clonal cells count. Although the mechanism leading to spontaneous remission remain uncharacterized, we hypothezised that a favorable adaptive immunity against concurrent viral infection could render an enhanced anti-tumor effect. We suppose COVID-19 infection have induced a transient remission in this patient affected with NK neoplasm."
Efficacy and safety of acupuncture for elderly patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture therapy for elderly patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Relevant articles from December 2019 to December 2020 will be searched in the following electronic databases: Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and China Scientific Journals Database. All published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and credible clinical observations about this topic will be included. Two independent researchers will operate article retrieval, duplication removing, screening and data analysis by EndNote X9.0 and Stata 15.0. We will use the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials to assess the risk of bias of included studies. Meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and/or descriptive analysis will be performed according to the data conditions included. RESULTS: High-quality synthesis and/or descriptive analysis of current evidence will be provided from mortality rate, cure rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine, troponin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and improvements in chest CT scans, clinical symptoms (including fever, fatigue, cough, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) and the side effects of acupuncture. CONCLUSION: This study will provide evidence of whether acupuncture is an effective and safe intervention for the elderly with COVID-19. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020225245."

The Experiences of Family Members of COVID-19 Patients in Iran: A Qualitative Study,"BACKGROUND: Being diagnosed with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) usually causes emotional stress for patients and their families. Understanding the challenges faced by family members of COVID-19 patients is necessary to provide holistic family centered care to support patients and families on their journey to recovery from COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of Iranian family members of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This qualitative study was performed using the conventional content analysis approach in 2020 in Gorgan, northeastern Iran. Using a purposive sampling 15 family members of inpatient and outpatient COVID-19 patients who were involved in caring of their patients were selected. Data were collected using in-depth and semi-structured interviews and were analyzed by Graneheim and Lundman's content analysis method with the support of MAXQDA software. RESULTS: Family members' experiences of COVID-19 patients were categorized into two main themes, four category and 10 subcategories. One of the main themes was “psychosocial distress”, with two categories of “uncertainty of the disease” and “perceived psychosocial burdens”. Another main theme was “adaptation strategies”, with the two sub-categories including “adaptative care” and “trusting God”. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide a broad range of context-specific challenges faced by family members of Covid-19 patients. It is essential for healthcare providers to be aware of the complex psychological and social conditions of families of Covid-19 patients. Hence, healthcare managers and policymakers should implement preventive and supportive programs at all levels in hospitals and community and provide supportive strategies to reduce or eliminate their challenges."
Assessing excess mortality in times of pandemics based on principal component analysis of weekly mortality data—the case of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 outbreak has called for renewed attention to the need for sound statistical analyses to monitor mortality patterns and trends over time. Excess mortality has been suggested as the most appropriate indicator to measure the overall burden of the pandemic in terms of mortality. As such, excess mortality has received considerable interest since the outbreak of COVID-19 began. Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are somewhat limited, as they do not include sufficiently long-term trends, correlations among different demographic and geographic groups, or autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased estimates of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be misinterpreted as excess mortality. We propose a novel approach that overcomes the named limitations and draws a more realistic picture of excess mortality. Our approach is based on an established forecasting model that is used in demography, namely, the Lee-Carter model. We illustrate our approach by using the weekly age- and sex-specific mortality data for 19 countries and the current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our findings show evidence of considerable excess mortality during 2020 in Europe, which affects different countries, age, and sex groups heterogeneously. Our proposed model can be applied to future pandemics as well as to monitor excess mortality from specific causes of death."

Evaluating sustainable efficiency of decision-making units considering undesirable outputs: an application to airline using integrated multi-objective DEA-TOPSIS,"Sustainable development has gained significant attention in the literature due to the increased global awareness of environmental sustainability during the last decade. Sustainable development has three aspects, including economic, social, and environmental. The challenge of sustainable development is to establish a balance between these three aspects. Assessing the efficiency of a company contributes comprehensive information to improve its overall performance. Despite numerous studies in this field, the literature lacks studies that simultaneously consider all three aspects of sustainable development, especially the social aspect. The main objective of this paper is to calculate the technical, social, and environmental efficiency scores. We also introduce a new efficiency called sustainable efficiency that merges all three sustainable development aspects in one efficiency score. This study applies two existing data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to evaluate technical, social, environmental, and sustainable efficiencies. These models, namely the three-step method and the modified three-step method, are computationally intensive. Also, this paper introduces two new DEA models, namely the common weight goal programming DEA and the common weight DEA, to assess the efficiencies with much fewer computations. Each model produces results that are different from one another. Therefore, the TOPSIS approach is applied to provide an overall result by integrating the results obtained from the four presented models. For this purpose, the implementation of four TOPSIS models is required. To illustrate the capability and validity of the developed models in efficiency calculation, a case of Iranian airlines is presented. The selected airlines are evaluated in different aspects, and final results are obtained by applying TOPSIS. The findings show that using TOPSIS to combine the results of several DEA models leads to a fully ranking of airlines in four aspects of technical, social, environmental, and sustainable efficiencies. Also, it is recommended to managers to probe pairwise comparison between different efficiencies of airlines in order to find and improve the weak ones."

"Response regarding the importance of vitamin D and calcium among undergraduate health sciences students in Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia","BACKGROUND: Vitamin D and calcium are essential dietary components for human body, and their deficiency is linked to poor bone health and osteoporosis. Adequate knowledge of health staff regarding vitamin D and calcium is critical for general population awareness. The current work was to evaluate the awareness regarding the importance of vitamin D and calcium among undergraduate health science students in Al Kharj. METHODS: A self-distributed validated questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted. Undergraduate health science students in Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University from the College of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, College of Dentistry, and College of Applied Medical Science were included in the study. Students between the age of 18 and 25 years have participated in the study. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-seven undergraduate health science students participated in the study. The vast majority of students knew about the importance of calcium (96.7%) and vitamin D (95.4%), whereas only 89.4% knew about osteoporosis. The participant students reported in their answers that the sources of knowledge were the Internet (42.8%), physicians (41.5%), textbooks (21.2%), teachers (19.1%), family and relatives (18.3%), and/or other sources (6.1%). The overall attitude was poor in about (54%) of the participants showing gender differences regarding sun-exposure duration and supplementation of calcium and vitamin D. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that both male and female undergraduate health science students in Al Kharj were familiar with the importance of vitamin D and calcium; however they reported improper attitude that warrants further health guidance and educational programs."
"Pivoting to Childbirth at Home or in Freestanding Birth Centers in the US During COVID-19: Safety, Economics and Logistics","Birth-related decisions principally center on safety; giving birth during a pandemic brings safety challenges to a new level, especially when choosing the birth setting. Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the concurrent work furloughs, business failures, and mounting public and private debt have made prudent expenditures an inescapable second concern. This article examines the intersections of safety, economic efficiency, insurance, liability and birthing persons’ needs that have become critical as the pandemic has ravaged bodies and economies around the world. Those interests, and the challenges and solutions discussed in this article, remain important even in less troubled times. Our economic analysis suggests that having an additional 10% of deliveries take place in private homes or freestanding birth centers could save almost $11 billion per year in the United States without compromising safety."
The Role of Micronutrients in Ageing Asia: What Can Be Implemented with the Existing Insights,"Life expectancy as a measure of population health does not reflect years of healthy life. The average life expectancy in the Asia-Pacific region has more than doubled since 1900 and is now above 70 years. In the Asia-Pacific region, the proportion of aged people in the population is expected to double between 2017 and 2050. Increased life expectancy leads to an increase in non-communicable diseases, which consequently affects quality of life. Suboptimal nutritional status is a contributing factor to the prevalence and severity of non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular, cognitive, musculoskeletal, immune, metabolic and ophthalmological functions. We have reviewed the published literature on nutrition and healthy ageing as it applies to the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on vitamins, minerals/trace elements and omega-3 fatty acids. Optimal nutritional status needs to start before a senior age is reached and before the consequences of the disease process are irreversible. Based on the nutritional status and health issues in the senior age in the region, micronutrients of particular importance are vitamins A, D, E, C, B-12, zinc and omega-3 fatty acids. The present paper substantiates the creation of micronutrient guidelines and proposes actions to support the achievement of optimal nutritional status as contribution to healthy ageing for Asia-Pacific populations."
Power Imbalance and the Dark Side of the Captive Agri-food Supplier–Buyer Relationship,"This paper highlights the dark side of power imbalance regarding its consequences in agri-food supplier–buyer relationships. We report on findings from two studies. The first study is based on a sample of 105 key informants, while study 2 is based on a sample of 444 key informants, all from the cocoa agri-food supply market of Ghana. While the first study focuses on the antecedents of power imbalance and its consequences, the second study explores the role of cooperatives/collective action in minimizing supplier exploitation. Data from these studies were analysed using the partial least squares technique (SmartPLS). Analysis of these findings shows switching costs’ impact on power imbalance to be curvilinear, while power imbalance has a curvilinear relationship with opportunism. The negative consequences of power imbalance are further exacerbated by dependency and the lack of joint action. Furthermore, we found the negative impact of power imbalance on financial performance to be stronger for non-cooperative members than for cooperative members, while, counterintuitively, we found the positive impact of economic satisfaction on financial performance to be stronger for non-cooperative members than for cooperative members."
COVID-19 causes unprecedented educational disruption: Is there a road towards a new normal?,"COVID-19 confronts the education system with a new and massive crisis. What should a “new normal” look like for future generations? How can countries use the innovativeness of the recovery period to “build back better”? This Viewpoint highlights the UNESCO-led Global Coalition for Education initiative, which is seeking solutions to support learners and teachers, as well as governments throughout the recovery process, with a principal focus on inclusion, equity, and gender equality. The Viewpoint also argues that the current crisis is an opportunity for stronger international collaboration, which might provide a better focus and deliver solutions, including digital tools. Resilience and adaptability will be crucial for the next generations to navigate through the present—and any future—pandemic."
Intervention of an Upgraded Ventilation System and Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Air Quality at Birmingham New Street Railway Station,"High NO(2) concentrations (long term average of 383 µg/m(3) in 2016/2017) recorded at Birmingham New Street railway station have resulted in the upgrade of the bi-directional fan system to aid wind dispersion within the enclosed platform environment. This paper attempts to examine how successful this intervention has been in improving air quality for both passengers and workers within the station. New air pollution data in 2020 has enabled comparisons to the 2016/2017 monitoring campaign revealing a 23–42% decrease in measured NO(2) concentrations. The new levels of NO(2) are below the Occupational Health standards but still well above the EU Public Health Standards. This reduction, together with a substantial decrease (up to 81%) in measured Particulate Matter (PM) concentrations, can most likely be attributed to the new fan system effectiveness. Carbon Monoxide levels were well below Occupational and Public Health Standards at all times. The COVID-19 pandemic “initial lockdown” period has also allowed an insight into the resultant air quality at lower rail-traffic intensities, which produced a further reduction in air pollutants, to roughly half the pre-lockdown concentrations. This study shows the scope of improvement that can be achieved through an engineering solution implemented to improve the ventilation system of an enclosed railway station. Further reduction in air pollution would require additional approaches, such as the removal of diesel engine exhaust emissions via the adoption of electric or diesel-electric hybrid powered services."
Concerning the unexpected prothrombotic state following some coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines.,"Currently, the world is coping with the COVID-19 pandemic with a few vaccines. So far, the European Medicine Agency has approved four of them. However, following widespread vaccination with the recombinant adenoviral vector-based Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, available only in the United Kingdom and Europe, many concerns have emerged, especially the report of several cases of the otherwise rare cerebral sinus vein thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis. The onset of thrombosis particularly at these unusual sites, about 5--14 days after vaccination, along with thrombocytopenia and other specific blood test abnormalities, are the main features of the vaccine side effects. The acronym vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) has been coined to name this new condition, with the aim of highlighting the difference from the classic heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). VIPIT seems to primarily affect young to middle-aged women. For this reason, the vaccine administration has been stopped or limited in a few European countries. Coagulopathy induced by the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (and probably by Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine as well in the USA) is likely related to the use of recombinant vector DNA adenovirus, as experimentally proven in animal models. Conversely, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA vectors. All vaccine-induced thrombotic events should be treated with a nonheparin anticoagulant. As the condition has some similarities with HIT, patients should not receive any heparin or platelet transfusion, as these treatments may potentially worsen the clinical course. Aspirin has limited rational use in this setting and is not currently recommended. Intravenous immunoglobulins may represent another potential treatment, but, most importantly, clinicians need to be aware of this new unusual postvaccination syndrome."

Deficient hand washing facilities in public toilets in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey in one high-income country,"Aims: To identify the extent of the provision of water and soap for hand washing in public toilets at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. To also make comparisons with a pre-pandemic survey that included a sample of the same facilities. Methods: We collected data from 400 toilets that were open to the public; all those in three contiguous city council territories (228) and a further convenience sample of 172 around the rest of New Zealand. Comparisons were made with the data on the same facilities included in a 2012/2013 survey. Results: For all the toilets in this survey, 2.5% had no water for hand washing and 14.8% had no soap. There was COVID-19 related health messaging signage in 19.5% of toilets, with posters of the COVID-19 QR code used to facilitate contact tracing in 12.3%, and generic hand washing signage in 1.8%. The hand washing water had 'no touch' activation at 28.0% of toilets and at 18.5% for toilet bowl flushing. Toilet bowl lids were not present at 32.8%, and 2.3% of toilets had damage which would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats). For the 128 sites that had also been examined in the previous survey, this new survey found significantly increased provision of soap (risk ratio = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.25 to 1.72), but no increased provision of water. Conclusions: Despite the serious threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of hand washing facilities in public toilets sampled required tap touching, and did not have health messaging. Nevertheless there has been some modest improvements in soap (but not water) provision since the previous survey eight years before."
Trustworthy Wireless Sensor Networks for Monitoring Humidity and Moisture Environments,"Wireless sensors networks (WSNs) are characterized by flexibility and scalability in any environment. These networks are increasingly used in agricultural and industrial environments and have a dual role in data collection from sensors and transmission to a monitoring system, as well as enabling the management of the monitored environment. Environment management depends on trust in the data collected from the surrounding environment, including the time of data creation. This paper proposes a trust model for monitoring humidity and moisture in agricultural and industrial environments. The proposed model uses a digital signature and public key infrastructure (PKI) to establish trust in the data source, i.e., the trust in the sensor. Trust in data generation is essential for real-time environmental monitoring and subsequent analyzes, thus timestamp technology is implemented here to further ensure that gathered data are not created or changed after the assigned time. Model validation is performed using the Castalia network simulator by testing energy consumption at the receiver and sender nodes and the delay incurred by creating or validating a trust token. In addition, validation is also performed using the Ascertia TSA Crusher application for the time consumed to obtain a timestamp from the free TSA. The results show that by applying different digital signs and timestamps, the trust entity of the WSN improved significantly with an increase in power consumption of the sender node by up to 9.3% and receiver node by up to 126.3% for a higher number of nodes, along with a packet delay of up to 15.6% and an average total time consumed up to 1.186 s to obtain the timestamp from the best chosen TSA, which was as expected."
Liver profile in COVID-19: a meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have been performed to investigate multiorgan failure occurring with extrapulmonary symptoms like diarrhea, anorexia, and vomiting. There has been no attempt at a systematic review on this major health issue. Hence, in this study, a meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify the overall risk of liver damage in COVID-19 patients and also find the overall variation in risk outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis was carried out on the findings of four published studies that were related to the albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of COVID-19 patients. The pooled mean for each of these three measurements was estimated by using a random-effects model. RESULTS: The pooled means for albumin, AST, and ALT in COVID-19 patients were 38.84 g/L [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.83–41.86], 27.28 IU/L (95% CI: 18.30–36.26), and 24.44 IU/L (95% CI: 15.73–33.15) respectively. There was a high degree of divergence among the studies, with the index of heterogeneity being more than 90%. CONCLUSION: The ALT and albumin pooled means were reported to be within the normal range; however, the pooled mean of the serum AST level was found to be high in COVID-19 patients. The pooled means reported in this study can be useful for working out the degree of liver damage in COVID-19 patients."

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression symptoms of young people in the global south: evidence from a four-country cohort study,"OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young people who grew up in poverty in low/middle-income countries (LMICs). DESIGN: A phone survey administered between August and October 2020 to participants of a population-based longitudinal cohort study established in 2002 comprising two cohorts born in 1994–1995 and 2001–2002 in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam. We use logistic regressions to examine associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, structural factors (gender, age), and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems, subjective well-being) measured at younger ages. SETTING: A geographically diverse, poverty-focused sample, also reaching those without mobile phones or internet access. PARTICIPANTS: 10 496 individuals were approached; 9730 participated. Overall, 8988 individuals were included in this study; 4610 (51%) men and 4378 (49%) women. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms consistent with at least mild anxiety or depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (≥5) or Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (≥5). RESULTS: Rates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) (95% CI 38.63% to 43.12%; (29.49–33.74)), and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) (95% CI 8.16% to 10.58%; (8.33–10.77)), mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Women were most affected in all countries except Ethiopia. Pandemic-related stressors such as health risks/expenses, economic adversity, food insecurity, and educational or employment disruption were risk factors for anxiety and depression, though showed varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent/peer relationships were protective factors, while long-term health or emotional problems were risk factors. CONCLUSION: Pandemic-related health, economic and social stress present significant risks to the mental health of young people in LMICs where mental health support is limited, but urgently needed to prevent long-term consequences."
"Genome Characterization of COVID-19 Lineage B.1.1.7 Detected in the First Six Patients of a Cluster Outbreak — Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China, May 2021",
IL-33–mediated Eosinophilia Protects against Acute Lung Injury,"Pneumonia-induced lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome can develop because of an inappropriate inflammatory response to acute infections, leading to a compromised alveolar barrier. Recent work suggests that hospitalized patients with allergies/asthma are less likely to die of pulmonary infections and that there is a correlation between survival from acute respiratory distress syndrome and higher eosinophil counts; thus, we hypothesized that eosinophils associated with a type 2 immune response may protect against pneumonia-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, mice were treated with the type 2–initiating cytokine IL-33 intratracheally 3 days before induction of pneumonia with airway administration of a lethal dose of Staphylococcus aureus. Interestingly, IL-33 pretreatment promoted survival by inhibiting acute lung injury: amount of BAL fluid proinflammatory cytokines and pulmonary edema were both reduced, with an associated increase in oxygen saturation. Pulmonary neutrophilia was also reduced, whereas eosinophilia was strongly increased. This eosinophilia was key to protection; eosinophil reduction eliminated both IL-33–mediated protection against mortality and inhibition of neutrophilia and pulmonary edema. Together, these data reveal a novel role for eosinophils in protection against lung injury and suggest that modulation of pulmonary type 2 immunity may represent a novel therapeutic strategy."
Inactivation of airborne microbial contaminants by a heat-pump-driven liquid-desiccant air-conditioning system,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increasing interest in controlling airborne virus transmission during the operation of air-conditioning systems. Therefore, beyond an examination of the ability of liquid-desiccant material itself to inactivate microbes, a heat-pump-driven liquid-desiccant air-conditioning system was proposed and constructed to experimentally investigate the effect of liquid-desiccant solution on the inactivation of airborne bacteria and fungi in various air-conditioning processes. The proposed system comprises a liquid-desiccant unit to dehumidify or humidify process air using a desiccant-solution and heat-pump unit to cool or heat it and accommodate solution thermal loads. The decrease in the concentration of airborne bacteria and fungi before and after passing through the system (i.e., inactivation efficiency) were compared for the base, summer, and winter operating modes. The results indicated that airborne fungi were less inactivated than bacteria because they possess more stress-resistant cellular structures that resist inactivation. During the air-conditioning processes in both the summer and winter operating modes, the bacterial and fungal inactivation efficiencies improved compared to the base mode owing to the contact with desiccant solution. The higher solution flow rate and solution temperature improved the bacterial inactivation efficiency by 27% for the winter compared to the summer mode. Conversely, because of possible growth of fungi in the heated and humidified supply air in the winter, the fungal inactivation efficiency improved by only 1.5% for the winter compared to the summer mode. In conclusion, the proposed system can contribute to control the airborne transmission of microbial contaminants while operating air-conditioning systems."
Applications and User Perceptions of Smart Glasses in Emergency Medical Services: Semistructured Interview Study,"BACKGROUND: Smart glasses have been gaining momentum as a novel technology because of their advantages in enabling hands-free operation and see-what-I-see remote consultation. Researchers have primarily evaluated this technology in hospital settings; however, limited research has investigated its application in prehospital operations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the potential of smart glasses to support the work practices of prehospital providers, such as emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 EMS providers recruited from 4 hospital-based EMS agencies in an urban area in the east coast region of the United States. The interview questions covered EMS workflow, challenges encountered, technology needs, and users’ perceptions of smart glasses in supporting daily EMS work. During the interviews, we demonstrated a system prototype to elicit more accurate and comprehensive insights regarding smart glasses. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the open coding technique. RESULTS: We identified four potential application areas for smart glasses in EMS: enhancing teleconsultation between distributed prehospital and hospital providers, semiautomating patient data collection and documentation in real time, supporting decision-making and situation awareness, and augmenting quality assurance and training. Compared with the built-in touch pad, voice commands and hand gestures were indicated as the most preferred and suitable interaction mechanisms. EMS providers expressed positive attitudes toward using smart glasses during prehospital encounters. However, several potential barriers and user concerns need to be considered and addressed before implementing and deploying smart glasses in EMS practice. They are related to hardware limitations, human factors, reliability, workflow, interoperability, and privacy. CONCLUSIONS: Smart glasses can be a suitable technological means for supporting EMS work. We conclude this paper by discussing several design considerations for realizing the full potential of this hands-free technology."
Antibody response patterns in COVID-19 patients with different levels of disease severity-Japan,"Background: We analyzed antibody response patterns according to level of disease severity in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan. Methods: We analyzed 611 serum specimens from 231 patients with COVID-19 (mild, 170; severe, 31; critical, 30). IgM and IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid protein (N) and spike 1 protein (S1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Findings: The peaks of fitting curves for the OD values of IgM and IgG antibodies against N appeared simultaneously, while those against S1 were delayed compared with N. The OD values of IgM against N and IgG against both N and S1 were significantly higher in the severe and critical cases than in the mild cases at 11 days after symptom onset. The seroconversion rates of IgG were higher than those of IgM against both N and S1 during the clinical course based on the optimal cut-off values defined in this study. The seroconversion rates of IgG and IgM against N and S1 were higher in the severe and critical cases than in the mild cases. Conclusion: Our findings show that a stronger antibody response occurred in COVID-19 patients with greater disease severity and there were low seroconversion rates of antibodies against N and S1 in the mild cases. The antibody response patterns in our population suggest a second infection pattern, leading us to hypothesize that cross-reactivity occurs between SARS-CoV-2 and past infection with other human coronaviruses."
Determining the Impact of COVID-19 on End-of-Life Experiences of Family Caregivers for People Living With Dementia,"COVID-19 has impacted all of our lives, but the population most at risk are older adults. Family caregivers (FCGs) for people living with dementia (PLWD) face challenges in providing care, which are compounded with the introduction of COVID-19 public health policies. The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of FCGs where the PLWD died during the COVID-19 pandemic. FCGs were invited to participate in an online survey to examine their caregiving experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the option of participating in a follow-up focus group. Sixteen FCGs whose family members with dementia died during the pandemic participated in the survey. A follow-up focus group was conducted to further examine how COVID-19 policies impacted their role as a caregiver in long-term care (LTC) and affected their ability to grieve. The results of the survey and focus group suggest that a lack of role clarity and inadequate communication channels between the FCG and LTC due to COVID-19 increased the strain FCGs faced during end-of-life care. At the end of life, public policies, such as reduced or no visitation, led to feelings of inadequacy and regret. Several participants also expressed appreciation for completing Advanced Care Planning documentation prior to COVID-19. Based on these results, policymakers can help ease the increased turmoil faced by FCGs during end-of-life care in future public health emergencies by involving FCGs of PLWD in the decision-making process. The completion of Advanced Care Planning documentation can also ease the burden FCGs may experience during end-of-life care."
Small-Molecule Inhibitors of the Coronavirus Spike: ACE2 Protein–Protein Interaction as Blockers of Viral Attachment and Entry for SARS-CoV-2,"[Image: see text] Inhibitors of the protein–protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2), which acts as a ligand–receptor pair that initiates the viral attachment and cellular entry of this coronavirus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are of considerable interest as potential antiviral agents. While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than that with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable/less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound library focused around the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel druglike compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC(50)’s of 0.2–3.0 μM), whereas control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs of interest identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not hACE2. While dyes seemed to be promiscuous inhibitors, DRI-C23041 showed some selectivity and inhibited the entry of two different SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudoviruses into hACE2-expressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC(50)’s (6–7 μM). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for SARS-CoV-2 attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular."
Lipid polymer hybrid nanocarriers as a combinatory platform for different anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs supported by computational studies,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated the potential of emergent pathogens to severely damage public health and global economies. As a consequence of the pandemic, millions of people have been forced into self-isolation, which has negatively affected the global economy. More efforts are needed to find new innovative approaches that could fundamentally change our understanding and management of this disaster. Herein, lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPH NPs) were utilized as a platform for the delivery of azithromycin or niclosamide in combination with piroxicam. The obtained systems were successfully loaded with both azithromycin and piroxicam (LPH(Azi–Pir)) with entrapment efficiencies (EE%) of 74.23 ± 8.14% and 51.52 ± 5.45%, respectively, or niclosamide and piroxicam (LPH(Nic–Pir)) with respective EE% of 85.14 ± 3.47% and 48.75 ± 4.77%. The prepared LPH NPs had a core–shell nanostructure with particle size ≈ 125 nm and zeta potential ≈ −16.5 irrespective of drug payload. A dose-dependent cellular uptake of both LPH NPs was observed in human lung fibroblast cells. An enhanced in vitro antiviral efficacy of both LPH(Azi–Pir) and LPH(Nic–Pir) was obtained over the mixed solution of the drugs. The LPH NPs of azithromycin or niclosamide with piroxicam displyed a promising capability to hinder the replication of SARS-CoV-2, with IC(50) of 3.16 and 1.86 μM, respectively. These results provide a rationale for further in vivo pharmacological as well as toxicological studies to evaluate the potential activity of these drugs to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, especially the concept of combination therapy. Additionally, the molecular docking of macrolide bioactive compounds against papain-like protease (PDB ID:6wuu) was achieved. A ligand-based study, especially rapid overlay chemical structure (ROCS), was also examined to identify the general pharmacophoric features of these compounds and their similarity to reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Molecular dynamic simulation was also implemented."
Perceptions of Telehealth Among Commercial Members Who Responded to a Patient-Experience Survey During the Onset of the Coronavirus-19 Pandemic.,"Introduction: The body of literature on telehealth perception among commercial members is limited. Therefore, we administered a patient-experienced survey (Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems [CG-CAHPS]) to determine member perceptions of telehealth, including willingness to pay for it and the likelihood to access it again. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design, and members were assigned into two groups: those who had a telehealth visit with their primary care provider (PCP) or a provider in the same practice and those who had a telehealth visit with a provider outside of their PCP's practice. Logistic regression models were used to observe group differences in telehealth perception. Results: A total of 444 members replied to the CG-CAHPS survey and had a virtual visit; 21.1% had a telehealth visit with a provider outside of their PCP's practice, and 78.8% had a telehealth visit with their PCP or a provider in the same practice. Compared with members who saw a provider outside of their PCP's practice, members who saw their PCP or a provider in the same practice had 3.76 higher odds (confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.49-9.44) of rating in-person care as no different than virtual care; 2.29 higher odds (95% CI: 1.30-4.04) of reporting they would likely use telehealth again in the future; and 1.70 higher odds (95% CI: 0.99-2.91) of responding that they would be willing to pay an in-office visit copay for a telehealth visit. Conclusion: These results suggest that the familiarity of a member's PCP extends to the provider's practice and impacts member outlook on telehealth."
Computational investigation of prolonged airborne dispersion of novel coronavirus-laden droplets,"We have performed highly accurate numerical simulations to investigate prolonged dispersion of novel coronavirus-laden droplets in classroom air. Approximately 10,900 virus-laden droplets were released into the air by a teacher coughing and tracked for 90 min by numerical simulations. The teacher was standing in front of multiple students in a classroom. To estimate viral transmission to the students, we considered the features of the novel coronavirus, such as the virus half-life. The simulation results revealed that there was a high risk of prolonged airborne transmission of virus-laden droplets when the outlet flow of the classroom ventilation was low (i.e., 4.3 and 8.6 cm/s). The rates of remaining airborne virus-laden droplets produced by the teacher coughing were 40% and 15% after 45 and 90 min, respectively. The results revealed that students can avoid exposure to the virus-laden droplets by keeping a large distance from the teacher (5.5 m), which is more than two times farther than the currently suggested social distancing rules. The results of this study provide guidelines to set a new protection plan in the classroom to prevent airborne transmission of virus-laden droplets to students."
"Longitudinal analysis of virus load, serum antibody levels and virus neutralizing activity in vitro in cases with less severe COVID-19","Background: Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a highly variable clinical course, varying from barely discernible signs of disease, to moderate flu-like symptoms and, occasionally, with life-threatening pneumonia and/or cytokine storm. The relationship between the nasopharyngeal virus load, IgA and IgG antibodies to both the S1-RBD-protein and the N-protein as well the neutralizing activity (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of moderately afflicted COVID-19 patients has not been investigated longitudinally so far. Methods: Several new serological methods to examine these parameters were developed and validated for the longitudinal investigation in three patients of a family which underwent a mild course of COVID-19. Findings: We observed that the virus load had almost completely disappeared after about four weeks, whereas serum antibodies showed a contrasting course. IgA levels to S1-RBD-protein and, to a lesser extent, to the N-protein, peaked about three weeks after clinical disease onset but declined soon thereafter. IgG levels rose continuously, reaching a plateau approximately six weeks after disease onset. NAbs in serum reached a peak about four weeks after disease onset but dropped to a lower level about six weeks later. Interpretation: Our data establishes associations of virus neutralization and a serological immune response foremost against Sars-CoV-2 S1-RDB-protein in a longitudinal manner."
"Point of Sale Advertising and Promotion of Cigarettes, Electronic Cigarettes, and Heated Tobacco Products in Warsaw, Poland—A Pilot Study","Prevalence of smoking and e-cigarette use among teenagers in Poland is high. Polish law bans most advertising and promotion for cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and heated tobacco products (HTPs). This study investigates marketing for these products at points of sale (POS) near secondary schools in Warsaw, Poland, noting if the advertising and promotion were allowed under current Polish laws. All POS within 250 m radii of five selected secondary schools in each of three Warsaw districts were assessed for tobacco and e-cigarette direct advertising, inside and outside; offers of gifts or promotional discounts; tobacco merchandising, and tobacco displays. Of the 112 POS surveyed, 83% exposed customers to some form of advertising or promotion of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or HTPs; in 76%, advertising or promotion that violated Polish law was present. More than 80% of POS surveyed displayed tobacco products; in 19%, these products were displayed near products of interest to minors. POS density observed here was 30.3 per km(2), higher than in other European cities. In Poland, a high proportion of POS near schools violates the law banning the advertisement and promotion of tobacco and nicotine consumer products through a dense tobacco retailer network."
A Post‐COVID Review of Classroom Practices,
Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles as Potential Therapeutic Approach for Acute Kidney Injury,"Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication of hospitalized patients and significantly increases morbidity and mortality, worsening costs and length of hospital stay. Despite this impact on healthcare system, treatment still remains only supportive (dialysis). Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles are a promising option as they recapitulate stem cells properties, overcoming safety issues related to risks or rejection or aberrant differentiation. A growing body of evidence based on pre-clinical studies suggests that extracellular vesicles may be effective to treat acute kidney injury and to limit fibrosis through direct interference with pathogenic mechanisms of vascular and tubular epithelial cell damage. We herein analyze the state-of-the-art knowledge of therapeutic approaches with stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles for different forms of acute kidney injury (toxic, ischemic or septic) dissecting their cytoprotective, regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. We also analyze the potential impact of extracellular vesicles on the mechanisms of transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease, with a focus on the pivotal role of the inhibition of complement cascade in this setting. Despite some technical limits, nowadays the development of therapies based on stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles holds promise as a new frontier to limit acute kidney injury onset and progression."
Variation in Employment in Healthcare Occupations and County-Level Differences in COVID-19 Cases in the United States of America,"To study how county-level differences in employment in healthcare occupations contributes to county-level differences in COVID-19 cases. METHOD: The number of active COVID-19 cases were gathered from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center weekly between April 22, 2020 and July 1, 2020. Data for the number of workers employed in healthcare occupations were collected at the county-level from the American Community Survey. These data were combined to explore the association between employment patterns and rates of COVID-19 cases. RESULT: Counties with more employment in healthcare-related occupations experienced higher rate of COVID-19. This association was strongest in April and May compared to later months of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Employment in healthcare occupations may contribute to the spread of COVID-19. Intervention to protect workers may help to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases."
COVID-19 and the gastrointestinal tract: more than meets the eye,
A case-control study on the association between periodontitis and coronavirus disease (COVID-19).,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and periodontitis share common characteristics, such as an exaggerated inflammatory response. As periodontal diseases were shown to be associated with respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, it is quite possible that a relationship may exist between periodontitis and COVID-19. Hence, the aim of the present study was to determine whether periodontitis and poor oral hygiene are associated with COVID-19. METHODS A case control study was conducted. Patients who had positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were included in the case group (n = 79), and patients with negative results were included in the control group (n = 71). The periodontal examination involved recording the plaque scores, calculus scores, tooth mobility, gingival bleeding, probing depth, recession, and clinical attachment level (CAL). RESULTS Logistic regression analysis showed significant associations of mean plaque scores ≥ 1 (odds ratio (OR), 7.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.83-26.94), gingivitis (OR, 17.65; 95% CI, 5.95-52.37), mean CAL ≥ 2 mm (OR, 8.46; 95% CI, 3.47-20.63), and severe periodontitis (OR, 11.75; 95% CI, 3.89-35.49) with COVID-19; these findings were more prevalent in the case group. CONCLUSION Based on the abovementioned observations, it can be concluded that there is an association between periodontitis severity and COVID-19. Gingival bleeding and dental plaque accumulation are also more frequent among COVID-19 patients. Hence, it is essential to maintain periodontal health and good oral hygiene as an important measure for COVID-19 prevention and management. This article is protected by copyright.

Activation of the Antiviral Kinase PKR and Viral Countermeasures,"The interferon-induced double-stranded (ds)RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) limits viral replication by an eIF2α-mediated block of translation. Although many negative-strand RNA viruses activate PKR, the responsible RNAs have long remained elusive, as dsRNA, the canonical activator of PKR, has not been detected in cells infected with such viruses. In this review we focus on the activating RNA molecules of different virus families, in particular the negative-strand RNA viruses. We discuss the recently identified non-canonical activators 5′-triphosphate RNA and the vRNP of influenza virus and give an update on strategies of selected RNA and DNA viruses to prevent activation of PKR."
COVID19-world: a shiny application to perform comprehensive country-specific data visualization for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic,"BACKGROUND: Data analysis and visualization is an essential tool for exploring and communicating findings in medical research, especially in epidemiological surveillance. RESULTS: Data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases and mortality, from January 1st, 2020, onwards is collected automatically from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). We have developed a Shiny application for data visualization and analysis of several indicators to follow the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic using ECDC data. A country-specific tool for basic epidemiological surveillance, in an interactive and user-friendly manner. The available analyses cover time trends and projections, attack rate, population fatality rate, case fatality rate, and basic reproduction number. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19-World online web application systematically produces daily updated country-specific data visualization and analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic worldwide. The application may help for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic worldwide."
Low-dose IL-2 therapy invigorates CD8(+) T cells for viral control in systemic lupus erythematosus,"Autoimmune diseases are often treated by glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs that could increase the risk for infection, which in turn deteriorate disease and cause mortality. Low-dose IL-2 (Ld-IL2) therapy emerges as a new treatment for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. To examine its influence on infection, we retrospectively studied 665 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) including about one third receiving Ld-IL2 therapy, where Ld-IL2 therapy was found beneficial in reducing the incidence of infections. In line with this clinical observation, IL-2 treatment accelerated viral clearance in mice infected with influenza A virus or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Noticeably, despite enhancing anti-viral immunity in LCMV infection, IL-2 treatment exacerbated CD8(+) T cell-mediated immunopathology. In summary, Ld-IL2 therapy reduced the risk of infections in SLE patients and enhanced the control of viral infection, but caution should be taken to avoid potential CD8(+) T cell-mediated immunopathology."

At the Core of Depression: A Diagnostic Interview of the Core Features of Depression,"INTRODUCTION: Valid and reliable methods for diagnosing depression are essential. The present study aimed to test the performance of a new diagnostic interview for depression focusing on the core symptoms of depression. METHOD: We developed a diagnostic interview for depression: the CORE Diagnostic Interview, CORE-DI, which assesses each of the core features of depression on the four dimensions: quality, reactivity, globality, and fluctuations over time. The diagnostic performance of this interview was tested in a clinical study including 83 individuals presenting with various depressive symptoms, who were interviewed independently (1) by means of the CORE-DI and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), and (2) by highly skilled specialists in depression representing gold standard diagnoses. RESULTS: We compared the outcome of the CORE-DI, the M.I.N.I., and the diagnosis made by clinicians, respectively, versus the gold standard diagnosis, using diagnostic efficiency statistics. The CORE-DI diagnosed depression with a high specificity (0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.97, for International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 criteria and 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.95, for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-5] criteria) compared to both M.I.N.I (specificity 0.44, 95% CI: 0.33-0.55) and clinical diagnoses (specificity 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67-0.85). The sensitivity of the CORE-DI was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.55-0.72) for ICD-10 criteria and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57-0.77) for DSM-5 criteria. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The CORE-DI increased the specificity of the depression diagnosis substantially compared to clinical diagnoses and the diagnoses obtained by M.I.N.I. The results point to the usefulness of an elaborated and systematic assessment of the core symptoms in the examination of patients with depressive symptoms and thereby indicate a way for further development of specific diagnostic tools for depression in both clinical and research settings. However, it should be noted that the sensitivity of the CORE-DI was modest, and the psychometric properties of the CORE-DI might be different in other settings with higher or lower prevalence or severity of depressive symptoms."
Flavonoids are promising safe therapy against COVID-19,"Flavonoids are a class of phenolic natural products, well-identified in traditional and modern medicines in the treatment of several diseases including viral infection. Flavonoids showed potential inhibitory activity against coronaviruses including the current pandemic outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and designated as COVID-19. Here, we have collected all data related to the potential inhibitory mechanisms of flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 infection and their significant immunomodulatory activities. The data were mapped and compared to elect major flavonoids with a promising role in the current pandemic. Further, we have linked the global existence of flavonoids in medicinal plants and their role in protection against COVID-19. Computational analysis predicted that flavonoids can exhibit potential inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 by binding to essential viral targets required in virus entry and/ or replication. Flavonoids also showed excellent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities including the inhibition of various inflammatory cytokines. Further, flavonoids showed significant ability to reduce the exacerbation of COVID-19 in the case of obesity via promoting lipids metabolism. Moreover, flavonoids exhibit a high safety profile, suitable bioavailability, and no significant adverse effects. For instance, plants rich in flavonoids are globally distributed and can offer great protection from COVID-19. The data described in this study strongly highlighted that flavonoids particularly quercetin and luteolin can exhibit promising multi-target activity against SARS-CoV-2, which promote their use in the current and expected future outbreaks. Therefore, a regimen of flavonoid-rich plants can be recommended to supplement a sufficient amount of flavonoids for the protection and treatment from SARS-CoV-2 infection."
A fast and cheap in-house magnetic bead RNA extraction method for COVID-19 diagnosis,"COVID-19 has posed a worldwide public health challenge affecting millions of people in different countries. Rapid and efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for pandemic control. Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs is the gold standard method for the virus detection, but the high demand for tests has substantially increased de costs and reduced the availability of reagents, including genetic material purification kits. Thus, the present study aimed to compare two bead-based RNA extraction methods (an in-house and a commercial kit) from nasopharyngeal swabs and RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-five positive and five negative nasopharyngeal swab samples were subjected to extraction of nucleic acids using both methods in an automated platform. Both protocols revealed a high correlation between Cycle Quantifications (Cqs) (r = 0.99, p < 0.0001). In addition, the in-house kit was 89.5% cheaper when compared to the mean cost of commercial RNA extraction kits. The results show that the in-house protocol is an affordable and reliable option for RNA extraction for SARS-CoV-2 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs."
Unusual lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum and coronavirus infectious disease-19,"Coronavirus infectious diseases (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that has taken a strong grip on the entire global community. The diagnosis per se is straightforward; however, the disease seems to affect multiple organs. Cytokine-storm, increased thromboembolic state, deranged overall homeostasis and aggressive medical treatment can cause a variety of lesions in the central nervous system. Interpretation of brain imaging findings will require a thorough understanding of the clinical status of the patient and treatment being offered, keeping in mind the several ways in which the viral pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 may interact with brain tissue. We present differential diagnosis of a MRI identified solitary lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, in a COVID-19 positive patient with altered mental status."
Resilience of Alzheimer’s Disease to COVID-19,"BACKGROUND: Facing the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most vulnerable individuals are seniors, especially those with comorbidities. More attention needs to been paid to the COVID-19 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the top age-related neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: Since it is unclear whether AD patients are prone to COVID-19 infection and progression to severe stages, we report for the first time a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of AD patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the clinical data of 19 AD patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with 23 non-AD COVID-19 patients admitted at the same time to our hospital. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Between AD patients and non-AD patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the pneumonia severity was not significantly different. AD patients had a higher clustering onset than non-AD patients. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization were shorter in AD patients than non-AD patients, indicating the former were sent to the hospital by their family or from nursing home earlier than the later. The median duration from hospitalization to discharge seemed shorter in AD patients than non-AD patients. Dementia patients seemed less likely to report fatigue. It is noticed that more AD patients might have pericardial effusion than the non-AD patients. CONCLUSION: AD patients with COVID-19 were in milder conditions with a better prognosis than non-AD patients. AD patients who had adequate access to healthcare showed resilience to COVID-19 with shorter hospital stays."

Promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs by effective dual targeting against the viral and host proteases,"SARS-CoV-2 caused dramatic health, social and economic threats to the globe. With this threat, the expectation of future outbreak, and the shortage of anti-viral drugs, scientists were challenged to develop novel antivirals. The objective of this study is to develop novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds with dual activity by targeting valuable less-mutated enzymes. Here, we have mapped the binding affinity of >500,000 compounds for potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), papain protease (PLpro) and human furin protease. The enzyme inhibition activity of most promising hits was screened and tested in vitro on SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate incubated with Vero cells. Computational modelling and toxicity of the compounds were validated. The results revealed that 16 compounds showed potential binding activity against Mpro, two of them showed binding affinity against PLpro and furin protease. Respectively, compounds 7 and 13 showed inhibition activity against Mpro at IC50 0.45 and 0.11µM, against PLpro at IC50 0.085 and 0.063µM, and against furin protease at IC50 0.29µM. Computational modelling validated the binding affinity against all proteases. Compounds 7 and 13 showed significant inhibition activity against the virus at IC50 0.77 and 0.11µM, respectively. Both compounds showed no toxicity on mammalian cells. The data obtained indicated that compounds 7 and 13 exhibited potent dual inhibition activity against SARS-CoV-2. The dual activity of both compounds can be of great promise not only during the current pandemic but also for future outbreaks since the compounds’ targets are of limited mutation and critical importance to the viral infection."
Case report of Takotsubo syndrome following seizures in a patient with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency,"BACKGROUND : Takotsubo syndrome (TS) is defined as transient left ventricular dysfunction, which is often related to an emotional or physically stressful event. We describe a case of TS in a lady with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (PCD). Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is rare condition with the majority of those affected demonstrating signs of failure to thrive, recurrent seizures, and metabolic acidosis. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of TS in an individual with PCD. CASE SUMMARY : This 28-year-old female presented to the emergency department after a tonic-clonic seizure. For 4 days prior to the presentation, she had been suffering from cough and pyrexia. On Day 2, she developed abdominal pain associated with tachycardia and hypotension, and an elevated troponin (791 ng/L). The echocardiogram showed a severely impaired left ventricular systolic function, regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs), and a visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 25–30%. Eight days following admission her clinical state significantly improved, with a reduction troponin to 60 ng/L. A repeat echocardiogram on Day 9 showed complete resolution of cardiac function with no RWMAs. Following this, she was discharged from hospital the next day with a diagnosis of TS. DISCUSSION : This is the first case report of TS in a patient with PCD. In this case, multiple aetiologies of TS such as emotional and physical stress, seizures, and acute infection were considered. This case also highlights that TS should be an important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with cardiac symptoms."
An independent endocytic pathway stimulates different monocyte subsets by the a2 N-terminus domain of vacuolar-ATPase,"The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) plays an important role in tumor progression and metastases. A novel peptide from the a2 isoform of V-ATPase called a2NTD has been shown to exert an immunoregulatory role in the tumor microenvironment by controlling the maturation of monocytes toward a tumor-associated macrophage phenotype. Our data indicate that a2NTD binds to the surface of monocytes. a2NTD was preferentially endocytosed by pro-inflammatory monocytes bearing a CD14(++)CD16(+) phenotype, which is associated with the monocyte-to-macrophage maturation process. Both a2NTD binding and internalization led to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β by CD14(++)CD16(-) (classical) and CD14(++)CD16(+ )(intermediate) monocytes. a2NTD was internalized via a macropinocytosis mechanism utilizing scavenger receptors. However, the inhibition of a2NTD endocytosis did not reduce cytokine production by monocytes. This points to the existence of two receptors that respond to a2NTD: scavengers receptors that mediate cellular uptake and an hitherto unidentified receptor stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines. Both of these monocyte receptors may be important in generating the localized inflammation that is often required to promote tumor growth and hence may constitute novel targets for the development of anticancer drugs."
The significant places of African American adults and their perceived influence on cardiovascular disease risk behaviors,"BACKGROUND: AA living in rural areas of the southeastern U.S. experience a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Neighborhood environmental factors contribute to this disparity and may decrease the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions aimed at preventing CVD. Furthermore, the influence of neighborhood factors on AA CVD risk behaviors (i.e. physical activity) may be obscured by the use of researcher-defined neighborhoods and researcher-defined healthy and unhealthy places. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of neighborhood environments on AA CVD risk behaviors among AA adults who recently completed a lifestyle intervention. We specifically sought to identify AA adults’ self-perceived places of significance and their perceptions of how these places impact CVD risk behaviors including diet, physical activity and smoking. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with AA adults (N = 26) living in two rural North Carolina counties (Edgecombe and Nash, North Carolina, USA). Participants were recruited from a community-based behavioral CVD risk reduction intervention. All had at least one risk factor for CVD. Participants identified significant places including where they spent the most time, meaningful places, and healthy and unhealthy places on local maps. Using these maps as a reference, participants described the impact of each location on their CVD risk behaviors. Data were transcribed verbatim and coded using NVivo 12. RESULTS: The average age of participants was 63 (SD = 10) and 92% were female. Places participants defined as meaningful and places where they spent the most time included churches and relatives’ homes. Healthy places included gyms and parks. Unhealthy places included fast food restaurants and relatives’ homes where unhealthy food was served. Place influenced CVD risk behaviors in multiple ways including through degree of perceived control over the environment, emotional attachment and loneliness, caretaking responsibilities, social pressures and social support. CONCLUSIONS: As we seek to improve cardiovascular interventions for rural AA in the American South, it will be important to further assess the effect of significant places beyond place of residence. Strategies which leverage or modify behavioral influences within person-defined significant places may improve the reach and effectiveness of behavioral lifestyle interventions.

Pooling-in-a-pod: A Strategy for COVID-19 Testing to Facilitate Safe Return to School,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted widespread primary and secondary school closures. Routine testing of asymptomatic students and staff, as part of a comprehensive program, can help schools open safely. ""Pooling-in-a-pod"" is a public health surveillance strategy whereby testing cohorts are composed based on social relationships and physical proximity. Pooling-in-a-pod allowed for weekly on-site point-of-care testing of all staff and students at an independent preschool to grade 12 school in Washington, D.C. Staff and older students self-collected anterior nares samples, and trained staff collected samples from younger students. Overall, 6,746 samples were tested for 815 students and 276 staff between November 30, 2020, and March 3, 2021. The average pool size was 7.3 people. Sample collection to pool result time averaged 40 minutes. The direct testing cost per person per week was $24.77, including swabs. One surveillance test pool was positive. During the study period, daily new cases in Washington, D.C., ranged from 24 - 46 per 100,000 population. A post-launch survey found most parents (90.3%), students (93.4%), and staff (98.8%) were willing to participate in pooled testing with confirmatory tests for positive pool members. The school reported a 32.6% decrease in virtual learning after initiation of the program. Pooling-in-a-pod is feasible, cost-effective, and an acceptable COVID-19 surveillance strategy for schools. School officials and policymakers can leverage this strategy to facilitate safe, sustainable, in-person schooling."
Efectividad de los glucocorticoides en pacientes hospitalizados por neumonía grave por SARS-CoV2,"Background: Several studies have reported the beneficial effect of glucocorticoids in the treatment of cytokine storm that occurs in patients with severe COVID-19. Various glucocorticoids regimens have been proposed. Methods: Retrospective observational study that includes patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and compares admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or death during hospitalization in three groups of patients: no glucocorticoids treatment, use of glucocorticoids doses equivalent to less than 250mg of prednisone daily and use of equivalent doses greater than or equal to 250 mg of prednisone daily. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression, using the propensity index as a covariant. Results: Of the 259 patients enrolled in the study, 67 (25.9%) had an unfavorable evolution, dying or requiring ICU admission. Comparative analyzes between different glucocorticoids treatments and the association with ICU admission or death were: glucocorticoids treatment (any dose) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.71 (0.30-1.66)), treatment with glucocorticoids (≥ 250 mg prednisone daily) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.35 (0.11-1.08)) and glucocorticoids treatment (≥ 250 mg prednisone daily) versus patients with glucocorticoids doses <250 mg prednisone daily or without glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.30 (0.10-0.88)). Conclusion: The results of this study show that patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with glucocorticoids pulses with equivalent doses of prednisone greater than or equal to 250 mg have a more favorable evolution (less mortality and less admission to ICU)."
Nationwide Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies among Four Groups of Primary Health-Care Workers and Their Household Contacts 6 Months after the Initiation of the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign in France: SeroPRIM Study Protocol,"Background: The protocol study will focus on the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 achieved by vaccination and/or natural protection as well as the history, symptoms, and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 in four primary health-care workers (PHCWs) and their household contacts in metropolitan France. Methods: Here, we propose a protocol for a nationwide survey to determine the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 achieved by vaccination and/or natural protection in four PHCW populations (general practitioners, pediatricians, pharmacists and assistants, and dentists and assistants) and their household contacts. Participants will be included from June to July 2021 (Phase 1) among PHCW populations located throughout metropolitan France. They will be asked to provide a range of demographic and behavioral information since the first SARS-CoV-2 wave and a self-sampled dried blood spot. Phase 1 will involve also a questionnaire and serological study of PHCWs’ household contacts. Seroprevalence will be estimated using two ELISAs designed to detect specific IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in humoral fluid, and these results will be confirmed using a virus neutralization test. This study will be repeated from November to December 2021 (Phase 2) to evaluate the evolution of immune status achieved by vaccination and/or natural protection of PHCWs and to describe the history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2."

Comparative dynamic aerosol efficiencies of three emergent coronaviruses and the unusual persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol suspensions,"The emergent coronavirus, designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a zoonotic pathogen that has demonstrated remarkable transmissibility in the human population and is the etiological agent of a current global pandemic called COVID-19. We measured the dynamic (short-term) aerosol efficiencies of SARS-CoV-2 and compared the efficiencies with two other emerging coronaviruses, SARS-CoV (emerged in 2002) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV; emerged starting in 2012). We also quantified the long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to maintain infectivity when suspended in aerosols for up to 16 hours."

Declining trends in birth prevalence and severity of singletons with cerebral palsy of prenatal or perinatal origin in Australia: A population-based observational study,"AIM: To investigate temporal trends in birth prevalence, disability severity, and motor type for singletons with prenatal or perinatally acquired cerebral palsy (CP). METHOD: Numerator data, number of children with CP born a singleton between 1995 and 2014, confirmed at 5 years of age, were drawn from three state registers with population-level ascertainment. Birth prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated per 1000 singleton live births for the three states combined, overall, by gestational age group, by dichotomized disability severity, and spastic laterality. Poisson regression models were used to analyse trends. Using data from all eight registers, trends in the proportional distribution of CP subtypes overall and stratified by gestational age were examined. RESULTS: Birth prevalence of CP declined from 1.8 (95% CI 1.6-2.0) in 1995 to 1996 to 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.4) in 2013 to 2014 (average 5% per 2-year epoch, p < 0.001). Declines in birth prevalence were observed across all gestational age groups with the largest decline in children born at <28 weeks (average 8% per epoch, p < 0.001). Prevalence of moderate-severe disability declined for children born at <28 and ≥37 weeks (average 11% and 7% per epoch respectively, p < 0.001). The proportions of bilateral spastic CP declined (p < 0.001) at <28 weeks (p = 0.014) and ≥37 weeks (p < 0.001). The proportion of children with dyskinesia increased (28-31 weeks: p = 0.021, 32-36 weeks: p = 0.001, and ≥37 weeks: p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Birth prevalence of CP and moderate-severe disability (<28 and ≥37 weeks) declined in Australian singletons between 1995 and 2014, reflecting changes in prenatal and perinatal care over time."
Mitarbeiterinfektionsschutz in Zeiten der Coronavirus-Pandemie: Die akute Implementierung von telemedizinischen Mitarbeiterkonferenzen „von Null auf Hundert“,"Background For medical professionals in hospitals, it is nearly impossible to abide by the rules of social distancing to prevent coronavirus transmission. In order to avoid unnecessary contact between medical staff, virtual medical boards were implemented. Methods Technical requirements for virtual boards were established overnight. Standard web cams and one license for a licensed provider of virtual boards were acquired. Most of the other technical gear required was readily available. Frequent and typical errors during the virtual boards were recorded and analyzed. Results Virtual boards provided the means for adequate patient care in spite of social distancing among the medical staff. Over a period of 4 weeks, 956 face-to-face contacts were avoided. Most errors occurred during first-time participation and concerned audio transmission. By muting the microphone of inactive participants, most of these errors could be avoided. Conclusions Virtual boards for medical staff can be implemented with minimal effort und standard technical gear to slow down the transmission of coronavirus among medical professionals in the hospital setting."

Immunogenicity and safety after the third dose of BNT162b2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in patients with solid tumors on active treatment: a prospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Although a full course of COVID-19 vaccine is effective in cancer patients, the duration of the protection and the efficacy of a booster dose against the new variants remain unknown. We prospectively evaluated the immunogenicity of the third dose of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in cancer patients undergoing active treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with solid cancer, vaccinated with a booster dose during active treatment, were enrolled in this study. Patients were classified in SARS-CoV-2 naïve (without previous COVID-19 infection) and SARS-CoV-2 experienced (with previous COVID-19 infection). Neutralizing antibody (NT Abs) titer and total anti-Spike IgG concentration were quantified in serum. Heparinized whole blood samples were used for SARS-CoV-2 Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). The primary endpoint was to assess the increase of IgG antibody level between baseline and 3 weeks after the booster. RESULTS: 142 consecutive patients were recruited. In SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects, median level of IgG was 157 BAU/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 62-423) at T0 and reached median of 2080 (IQR 2080-2080) at three weeks after booster administration (T1; p<0.0001). A median 16-fold increase of SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs titre (IQR 4-32) was observed in naïve subjects (from median 20 IQR 10-40 to median 640 IQR 160-640; p<0.0001). Median IFN-γ level at T1 was significantly higher than that measured at T0 in SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects (p=0.0049) but not in SARS-CoV-2 experienced patients. The median level of SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs was 32-fold lower against Omicron compared to wild type strain (p=0.0004) and 12-fold lower compared to Delta strain (p=0.0110) CONCLUSIONS: The third dose is able to trigger both the humoral and the cell-mediated immune response in cancer patients on active treatment. Our preliminary data about the neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine against variants of concern (VOCs) seem to confirm the vaccine lower activity."
A novel extended model with versatile shaped failure rate: Statistical inference with Covid -19 applications,"Statistical models perform an essential role in data analysis, and statisticians are constantly looking for novel or pretty recent statistical models to fit data sets across a broad variety of fields. In this study, we used modified Kies generalized transformation and the new power function to suggest an unique statistical model. We present and discuss a linear illustration of the density function. Theoretically, quantile function, characteristic function, stochastic ordering, mean, and moments are just a few of the structure properties we discuss. By defining an ideal statistical distribution for assessing the COVID-19 mortality rate, an attempt is performed to determine the model of COVID-19 spread in different nations like the United Kingdom and Italy. In some countries, the novel distribution have been shown to be more appropriate than existing competing models when fitted to COVID-19."
"Factores pronósticos en pacientes hospitalizados con diagnóstico de infección por SARS-CoV-2 en Bogotá, Colombia","INTRODUCTION: Infection with the new SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus is a worldwide public health emergency; its diagnosis is based on molecular tests, while its prognosis depends on the patient's history and on some paraclinical tests. In Colombia, forecasts are not yet counted. OBJECTIVE: To assess the factors associated with the development of severe disease in hospitalized patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the prognostic factors for the outcome of mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an ambispective cohort study in hospitalized patients at the Fundación Cadioinfantil from March to June, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients analyzed, 31.7% (n=33) had a severe presentation and 9.6% (n=10) had a mortality outcome. For mortality, the most important prognostic factor was the development of severe disease followed by age over 60 years and malnutrition. For the development of the severe disease, prognostic factors were a history of hemodialysis (HR=135), diabetes (HR=4.4), and an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (HR=1,004), while the lymphocyte count over 1,064 was a protective factor (HR=0.9). In the classification of patients, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) score in the high and low-risk categories corresponded to the best performance. There was no difference between the treatments administered. CONCLUSIONS: The most important prognostic factors for mortality were being over 60 years of age, hypertension, diabetes, and cirrhosis, while for the development of severe disease they were chronic kidney disease with hemodialysis, NEWS2 with high risk at admission, increased levels of LDH and C reactive protein (CRP), and leukocytosis."
Recent trends in protein and peptide-based biomaterials for advanced drug delivery,
Designing a multi-epitope peptide-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted so far 14,395,16 confirmed cases with 85,711 deaths from the 212 countries, or territories. Due to multifacet issues and challenges in implementation of the safety & preventive measures, inconsistent coordination between societies-governments and most importanly lack of specific vaccine to SARS-CoV-2, the spread of Wuhan originated virus is still uprising after taking a heavy toll on human life. In the present study, we mapped several immunogenic epitopes (B-cell, T-cell, and IFN-gamma) over the entire structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and by applying various computational and immunoinformatics approaches, we designed a multi-epitope peptide based vaccine that predicted high immunogenic response in the largest proportion of world’s human population. To ensure high expression of the recombinant vaccine in E. coli, codon optimization and in-silico cloning were also carried out. The designed vaccine with high molecular affinity to TLR3 and TLR4, was found capable to initiate effective innate and adaptive immune response. The immune simulation also suggested uprising high levels of both B-cell and T-cell mediated immunity which on subsequent exposure cleared antigen from the system. The proposed vaccine found promising by yielding desired results and hence, should be tested by practical experimentations for its functioning and efficacy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2."
A Feasibility Trial to Evaluate the Composite Efficacy of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in the Treatment of Covid 19 Pneumonia : Impact on Viral Load and Clinical Outcomes,"Background: Hypoxic patients with Covid 19 pneumonia are at high risk of adverse outcomes. Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) inhibits viral entry and replication of SARS-CoV2 and in vivo proof of its antiviral actions is unavailable to date. This feasibility study was conducted to test the antiviral effects of iNO and to describe clinical outcomes. Methods: The phase II open label, randomised controlled feasibility trial(ISRCTN 16806663) conducted at a South Indian tertiary care referral centre, recruited COVID-19 pneumonia patients with hypoxic respiratory failure and allocated them into iNO cases and control groups(1:1). iNO was administered as pulses for 30 minutes for three consecutive days at 12-hour intervals in cases, in addition to standard of care received by the control group. The primary outcome was decline in viral load, as defined by a surrogate change in the RT-PCR cycle threshold. The co-primary clinical outcome was time to improvement of >2 points on the WHO Ordinal Scale(WOS). Results: Among the 29 patients enrolled, 14 iNO cases and 11 controls completed the study protocol. Longitudinal analysis revealed a significant difference in the decline (p <0.002, N= 23) in viral load among the iNO cases compared to controls. The proportion of patients achieving 2-point improvement in the WOS within 14 days of randomisation was significantly higher in the iNO cases (n=11, 79%), as compared to the controls (n=4, 36%) (p=0.05). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated significant improvement in virological and clinical outcomes among patients with adjunct iNO therapy and no adverse effects were reported."
Design of chemical libraries with potentially bioactive molecules applying a maximum common substructure concept,"Success in small molecule screening relies heavily on the preselection of compounds. Here, we present a strategy for the enrichment of chemical libraries with potentially bioactive compounds integrating the collected knowledge of medicinal chemistry. Employing a genetic algorithm, substructures typically occurring in bioactive compounds were identified using the World Drug Index. Availability of compounds containing the selected substructures was analysed in vendor libraries, and the substructure-specific sublibraries were assembled. Compounds containing reactive, undesired functional groups were omitted. Using a diversity filter for both physico-chemical properties and the substructure composition, the compounds of all the sublibraries were ranked. Accordingly, a screening collection of 16,671 compounds was selected. Diversity and chemical space coverage of the collection indicate that it is highly diverse and well-placed in the chemical space spanned by bioactive compounds. Furthermore, secondary assay-validated hits presented in this study show the practical relevance of our library design strategy.

Host DDX Helicases as Possible SARS-CoV-2 Proviral Factors: A Structural Overview of Their Hijacking Through Multiple Viral Proteins,"As intracellular parasites, viruses hijack the host cell metabolic machinery for their replication. Among other cellular proteins, the DEAD-box (DDX) RNA helicases have been shown to be hijacked by coronaviruses and to participate in essential DDX-mediated viral replication steps. Human DDX RNA helicases play essential roles in a broad array of biological processes and serve multiple roles at the virus-host interface. The viral proteins responsible for DDX interactions are highly conserved among coronaviruses, suggesting that they might also play conserved functions in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. In this review, we provide an update of the structural and functional data of DDX as possible key factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 hijacking mechanisms. We also attempt to fill the existing gaps in the available structural information through homology modeling. Based on this information, we propose possible paths exploited by the virus to replicate more efficiently by taking advantage of host DDX proteins. As a general rule, sequestration of DDX helicases by SARS-CoV-2 is expected to play a pro-viral role in two ways: by enhancing key steps of the virus life cycle and, at the same time, by suppressing the host innate immune response."
Symptom clusters in Covid19: A potential clinical prediction tool from the COVID Symptom study app,"As no one symptom can predict disease severity or the need for dedicated medical support in COVID-19, we asked if documenting symptom time series over the first few days informs outcome. Unsupervised time series clustering over symptom presentation was performed on data collected from a training dataset of completed cases enlisted early from the COVID Symptom Study Smartphone application, yielding six distinct symptom presentations. Clustering was validated on an independent replication dataset between May 1- May 28th, 2020. Using the first 5 days of symptom logging, the ROC-AUC of need for respiratory support was 78.8%, substantially outperforming personal characteristics alone (ROC-AUC 69.5%). Such an approach could be used to monitor at-risk patients and predict medical resource requirements days before they are required."
Drivers of Automation and Consequences for Jobs in Engineering Services: An Agent-Based Modelling Approach,"New technology is of little use if it is not adopted, and surveys show that less than 10% of firms use Artificial Intelligence. This paper studies the uptake of AI-driven automation and its impact on employment, using a dynamic agent-based model (ABM). It simulates the adoption of automation software as well as job destruction and job creation in its wake. There are two types of agents: manufacturing firms and engineering services firms. The agents choose between two business models: consulting or automated software. From the engineering firms’ point of view, the model exhibits static economies of scale in the software model and dynamic (learning by doing) economies of scale in the consultancy model. From the manufacturing firms’ point of view, switching to the software model requires restructuring of production and there are network effects in switching. The ABM matches engineering and manufacturing agents and derives employment of engineers and the tasks they perform, i.e. consultancy, software development, software maintenance, or employment in manufacturing. We find that the uptake of software is gradual; slow in the first few years and then accelerates. Software is fully adopted after about 18 years in the base line run. Employment of engineers shifts from consultancy to software development and to new jobs in manufacturing. Spells of unemployment may occur if skilled jobs creation in manufacturing is slow. Finally, the model generates boom and bust cycles in the software sector."

"SARS-CoV-2 Delta vaccine breakthrough transmissibility in Alachua County, Florida","BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has caused a dramatic resurgence in infections in the United Sates, raising questions regarding potential transmissibility among vaccinated individuals. METHODS: Between October 2020 and July 2021, we sequenced 4,439 SARS-CoV-2 full genomes, 23% of all known infections in Alachua County, Florida, including 109 vaccine breakthrough cases. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between viral RNA burden and patient characteristics. Contact tracing and phylogenetic analysis were used to investigate direct transmissions involving vaccinated individuals. RESULTS: The majority of breakthrough sequences with lineage assignment were classified as Delta variants (74.6%) and occurred, on average, about three months (104 ± 57.5 days) after full vaccination, at the same time (June-July 2021) of Delta variant exponential spread within the county. Six Delta variant transmission pairs between fully vaccinated individuals were identified through contact tracing, three of which were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Delta breakthroughs exhibited broad viral RNA copy number values during acute infection (IQR 1.2 - 8.64 Log copies/ml), on average 38% lower than matched unvaccinated patients (3.29 - 10.81 Log copies/ml, p<0.00001). Nevertheless, 49-50% of all breakthroughs, and 56-60% of Delta-infected breakthroughs exhibited viral RNA levels above the transmissibility threshold (4 Log copies/ml) irrespective of time post vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Delta infection transmissibility and general viral RNA quantification patterns in vaccinated individuals suggest limited levels of sterilizing immunity that need to be considered by public health policies. In particular, ongoing evaluation of vaccine boosters should specifically address whether extra vaccine doses curb breakthrough contribution to epidemic spread."
A comprehensive review of SARS-CoV-2 genetic mutations and lessons from animal coronavirus recombination in one health perspective,"SARS-CoV-2 was originated from zoonotic coronaviruses and confirmed as a novel beta-coronavirus, which causes serious respiratory illness such as pneumonia and lung failure, COVID-19. In this review, we describe the genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including types of mutation, and molecular epidemiology, highlighting its key difference from animal coronaviruses. We further summarized the current knowledge on clinical, genetic, and pathological features of several animal coronaviruses and compared them with SARS-CoV-2, as well as recent evidences of interspecies transmission and recombination of animal coronaviruses to provide a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in One Health perspectives. We also discuss the potential wildlife hosts and zoonotic origin of this emerging virus in detail, that may help mitigate the spread and damages caused by the disease."
The use of mobile phones for the prevention and control of arboviral diseases: a scoping review,"BACKGROUND: The rapid expansion of dengue, Zika and chikungunya with large scale outbreaks are an increasing public health concern in many countries. Additionally, the recent coronavirus pandemic urged the need to get connected for fast information transfer and exchange. As response, health programmes have -among other interventions- incorporated digital tools such as mobile phones for supporting the control and prevention of infectious diseases. However, little is known about the benefits of mobile phone technology in terms of input, process and outcome dimensions. The purpose of this scoping review is to analyse the evidence of the use of mobile phones as an intervention tool regarding the performance, acceptance, usability, feasibility, cost and effectiveness in dengue, Zika and chikungunya control programmes. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of studies and reports by systematically searching: i) electronic databases (PubMed, PLOS ONE, PLOS Neglected Tropical Disease, LILACS, WHOLIS, ScienceDirect and Google scholar), ii) grey literature, using Google web and iii) documents in the list of references of the selected papers. Selected studies were categorized using a pre-determined data extraction form. Finally, a narrative summary of the evidence related to general characteristics of available mobile health tools and outcomes was produced. RESULTS: The systematic literature search identified 1289 records, 32 of which met the inclusion criteria and 4 records from the reference lists. A total of 36 studies were included coming from twenty different countries. Five mobile phone services were identified in this review: mobile applications (n = 18), short message services (n=7), camera phone (n = 6), mobile phone tracking data (n = 4), and simple mobile communication (n = 1). Mobile phones were used for surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, and communication demonstrating good performance, acceptance and usability by users, as well as feasibility of mobile phone under real life conditions and effectiveness in terms of contributing to a reduction of vectors/ disease and improving users-oriented behaviour changes. It can be concluded that there are benefits for using mobile phones in the fight against arboviral diseases as well as other epidemic diseases. Further studies particularly on acceptance, cost and effectiveness at scale are recommended.

Implementation of a Psychiatric Consultation for Healthcare Workers during First Wave of COVID-19 Outbreak,"Background: Prevention and management strategies of mental suffering in healthcare workers appeared as important challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article aims to: (1) show how potential psychiatric disorders for healthcare workers (HCW) during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak were identified; (2) present an activity report of this consultation; and (3) analyze and learn from this experience for the future. Methods: We performed a retrospective quantitative analysis of socio-demographic and clinical data, in addition to psychiatric scales scores for the main potential psychiatric risks (PDI, PDEQ, PCL-5, HADS, MBI-HSS) and post-hoc qualitative analysis of written interviews. Results: Twenty-five healthcare workers consulted between 19 March 2020 and 12 June 2020. We found 78.57% presented high peritraumatic dissociation and peritraumatic distress, 68.75% had severe anxiety symptoms, and 31.25% had severe depression symptoms. Concerning burnout, we found that 23.53% had a high level of emotional exhaustion. In the qualitative analysis of the written interview, we found a direct link between stress and the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily concerning traumatic stressors, and secondarily with work-related stress. Conclusions: Early detection of traumatic reactions, valorization of individual effort, and limitations on work overload appear like potential key preventive measures to prevent psychiatric complications for healthcare workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Exacerbation of preexisting neurological symptoms and COVID-19 severity in patients with comorbid neurological disorders and COVID-19: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic diseases usually develop severe 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with neurological disorders. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 and its effect on preexisting neurological symptoms in patients with comorbid neurological disorder and COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) and medRxiv databases for reports of patients with both neurological disorders and COVID-19. Studies reporting data on changes in the symptoms of preexisting neurological disorders and/or the severity of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles with 2278 patients with comorbid neurological disorder and COVID-19 were identified. Of 232 patients, 74 (31.9 %) showed exacerbation of preexisting neurological symptoms of dementia (55/92; 59.5 %), Parkinson’s disease (10/17; 58.8 %), epilepsy (1/1; 100 %), and unspecified neurological disorders (8/106; 7.5 %). Of 2168 patients, 478 (22.0 %) showed severe COVID-19 course. These included patients with cerebrovascular disease (86/445; 19.3 %), dementia (70/316; 22.2 %), Parkinson’s disease (25/214; 11.7 %), multiple sclerosis (28/71; 39.4 %), spinal cord injury (5/7; 71.4 %), and unspecified neurological disorders (254/1011; 25 %). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with comorbid neurological disorders and COVID-19 may develop more severe preexisting neurological symptoms and COVID-19. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of symptom exacerbation and severe COVID-19 in patients with neurological disease and should focus on the prevention and early care of COVID-19."
Development and application of a field knowledge graph and search engine for pavement engineering,"Integrated, timely data about pavement structures, materials and performance information are crucial for the continuous improvement and optimization of pavement design by the engineering research community. However, at present, pavement structures, materials and performance information in China are relatively isolated and cannot be integrated and managed. This results in a waste of a large amount of effective information. One of the significant development trends of pavement engineering is to collect, analyze, and manage the knowledge assets of pavement information to realize intelligent decision-making. To address these challenges, a knowledge graph (KG) is adopted, which is a novel and effective knowledge management technology and provides an ideal technical method to realize the integration of information in pavement engineering. First, a neural network model is used based on the principle of deep learning to obtain knowledge. On this basis, the relationship between knowledge is built from siloed databases, data in textual format and networks, and the knowledge base. Second, KG-Pavement is presented, which is a flexible framework that can integrate and ingest heterogeneous pavement engineering data to generate knowledge graphs. Furthermore, the index and unique constraints on attributes for knowledge entities are proposed in KG-Pavement, which can improve the efficiency of internal retrieval in the system. Finally, a pavement information search engine based on a knowledge graph is constructed to realize information interaction and target information matching between a webpage server and graph database. This is the first successful application of knowledge graphs in pavement engineering. This will greatly promote knowledge integration and intelligent decision-making in the domain of pavement engineering."
A Quantitative Approach to Unravel the Role of Host Genetics in IgG-FcγR Complex Formation After Vaccination,"Fc-mediated immune functions have been correlated with protection in the RV144 HIV vaccine trial and are important for immunity to a range of pathogens. IgG antibodies (Abs) that form complexes with Fc receptors (FcRs) on innate immune cells can activate Fc-mediated immune functions. Genetic variation in both IgGs and FcRs have the capacity to alter IgG-FcR complex formation via changes in binding affinity and concentration. A growing challenge lies in unraveling the importance of multiple variations, especially in the context of vaccine trials that are conducted in homogenous genetic populations. Here we use an ordinary differential equation model to quantitatively assess how IgG1 allotypes and FcγR polymorphisms influence IgG-FcγRIIIa complex formation in vaccine-relevant settings. Using data from the RV144 HIV vaccine trial, we map the landscape of IgG-FcγRIIIa complex formation predicted post-vaccination for three different IgG1 allotypes and two different FcγRIIIa polymorphisms. Overall, the model illustrates how specific vaccine interventions could be applied to maximize IgG-FcγRIIIa complex formation in different genetic backgrounds. Individuals with the G1m1,17 and G1m1,3 allotypes were predicted to be more responsive to vaccine adjuvant strategies that increase antibody FcγRIIIa affinity (e.g. glycosylation modifications), compared to the G1m-1,3 allotype which was predicted to be more responsive to vaccine boosting regimens that increase IgG1 antibody titers (concentration). Finally, simulations in mixed-allotype populations suggest that the benefit of boosting IgG1 concentration versus IgG1 affinity may be dependent upon the presence of the G1m-1,3 allotype. Overall this work provides a quantitative tool for rationally improving Fc-mediated functions after vaccination that may be important for assessing vaccine trial results in the context of under-represented genetic populations."
Analysis of Surgery Residency Website Content: Implications during the COVID-19 Era,"BACKGROUND: Surgery residency program websites (SRW) are an important source of information for prospective applicants. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred a pivot from the traditional in-person interview format to interviews via virtual platforms. Because of the inability to meet in person, the information provided on program websites takes on an increased relevance to applicants. We hypothesized that SRW may be missing content important to applicants. Our study aims to assess SRW for the content which impacts the applicant decision-making process. METHODS: An internal survey distributed to fourth-year medical students in 2020 at a single academic institution identified the website content most important to applicants. A list of ACGME-accredited SRW as of December 1, 2020 was obtained. Using the Fellowship and Residency Electronic and Interactive Database, websites were assessed for content parameters identified by the survey. RESULTS: Medical students applying to surgical specialties identified fellowship acquisition (94%), faculty information (88%), application contact information (82%), and resident wellness (77%) as the most important website content. Review of SRW websites identified content pertaining to fellowship acquisition and resident wellness in only 60% and 27% of cases respectively. Overall, the SRW of university programs included the most content parameters, followed by hybrid programs, then community programs. CONCLUSIONS: Many SRW are missing information that applicants deem important in their decision-making process. Most notably, there is a relative deficiency in information pertaining to fellowship match results and resident wellness. University based programs tend to include more of this information on their websites. SRW should continue to adapt to meet the needs of applicants in an increasingly virtual age."
Imaging Axonal Degeneration and Repair in Preclinical Animal Models of Multiple Sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) disease characterized by chronic neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage. Infiltration of activated lymphocytes and myeloid cells are thought to be primarily responsible for white matter damage and axonopathy. Over time, this neurologic damage manifests clinically as debilitating motor and cognitive symptoms. Existing MS therapies focus on symptom relief and delay of disease progression through reduction of neuroinflammation. However, long-term strategies to remyelinate, protect, or regenerate axons have remained elusive, posing a challenge to treating progressive forms of MS. Preclinical mouse models and techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and genomic and proteomic analysis have provided advances in our understanding of discrete time-points of pathology following disease induction. More recently, in vivo and in situ two-photon (2P) microscopy has made it possible to visualize continuous real-time cellular behavior and structural changes occurring within the CNS during neuropathology. Research utilizing 2P imaging to study axonopathy in neuroinflammatory demyelinating disease has focused on five areas: (1) axonal morphologic changes, (2) organelle transport and health, (3) relationship to inflammation, (4) neuronal excitotoxicity, and (5) regenerative therapies. 2P imaging may also be used to identify novel therapeutic targets via identification and clarification of dynamic cellular and molecular mechanisms of axonal regeneration and remyelination. Here, we review tools that have made 2P accessible for imaging neuropathologies and advances in our understanding of axonal degeneration and repair in preclinical models of demyelinating diseases."
Defining heart disease risk for death in COVID-19 infection,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was in common in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and associated with unfavorable outcomes. We aimed to compare the clinical observations and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with or without CVD. METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were clinically evaluated at Wuhan Seventh People’s Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 23 to March 14, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments and outcomes were collected and analyzed in COVID-19 patients with and without CVD. RESULTS: Among 596 patients with COVID-19, 215 (36.1%) of them with CVD. Compared with patients without CVD, these patients were significantly older (66 years vs 52 years) and had higher proportion of men (52.5% vs 43.8%). Complications in the course of disease were more common in patients with CVD, included acute respiratory distress syndrome (22.8% vs 8.1%), malignant arrhythmias (3.7% vs 1.0%) including ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, acute coagulopathy(7.9% vs 1.8%), and acute kidney injury(11.6% vs 3.4%). The rate of glucocorticoid therapy (36.7% vs 25.5%), Vitamin C (23.3% vs 11.8%), mechanical ventilation (21.9% vs 7.6%), intensive care unit admission (12.6% vs 3.7%) and mortality (16.7% vs 4.7%) were higher in patients with CVD (both p < 0.05). The multivariable Cox regression models showed that older age (≥65 years old) (HR 3.165, 95%CI 1.722-5.817) and patients with CVD (HR 2.166, 95%CI 1.189-3.948) were independent risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: CVD are independent risk factors for COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with CVD were more severe and had higher mortality rate, early intervention and vigilance should be taken."
A review on protective roles and potential mechanisms of metformin in diabetic patients diagnosed with COVID-19,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), is currently the leading threat to public health and a huge challenge to the healthcare systems across the globe and caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Obesity, a state of chronic inflammation, and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for severe SARS‐CoV‐2. Metformin is one of the most commonly used antidiabetic medications that displayed immunomodulatory activity through AMP-activated protein kinase. Metformin has sex-specific immunomodulatory and cytokine-reducing activities. Therefore, this review aimed to summarize the protective roles of Metformin and its possible molecular mechanisms for use in COVID-19 patients. To include studies, publications related to Metformin and its possible molecular mechanisms for COVID-19 were searched from the databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, Elsevier, Google Scholar, and SCOPUS, via English key terms. Maintaining proper blood glucose levels using oral antidiabetic drugs like Metformin reduced the detrimental effects of COVID-19 by different possible mechanisms such as Metformin-mediated anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities; effect on viral entry and ACE2 stability; inhibition of virus infection; alters virus survival and endosomal pH; mTOR inhibition; and influence on gut microbiota. Fascinatingly, in diabetic patients with COVID-19, treatment with Metformin was associated with a noticeable reduction in mortality rates and disease severity among infected patients. Metformin was comprehensively investigated for its anti-inflammatory, antiviral capabilities, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant, which would elucidate its capability to confer vascular and cardiopulmonary protection in COVID-19."
Management of malaria in children under 5-years-old during COVID-19 pandemic in Sierra Leone: a lesson learned?,"Growing evidences are showing the potential indirect effects of COVID-19 on the health systems of low-resource settings, where diseases such as Tuberculosis, HIV and Malaria represent major killers. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on Malaria programs in a peripheral region of Sierra Leone, previously involved by the Ebola outbreak in 2015, when malaria care have been impaired since local health systems were overwhelmed by Ebola cases. During COVID-19 in Sierra Leone, we did not notice a drop in malaria diagnosis in children, suggesting that a proactive approach in the management of malaria in endemic countries during COVID-19 may have had a positive impact. A comprehensive approach that include also educational activities to sensitize the local population, was useful to guarantee successful malaria diagnosis and treatment, and prevents excess of malaria deaths due to potential disruption of the local health systems related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."
Machine Learning to Predict Mortality and Critical Events in a Cohort of Patients With COVID-19 in New York City: Model Development and Validation,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide and is responsible for several hundred thousand fatalities. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods to meet these needs are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City; to develop machine learning models for making predictions about the hospital course of the patients over clinically meaningful time horizons based on patient characteristics at admission; and to assess the performance of these models at multiple hospitals and time points. METHODS: We used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and baseline comparator models to predict in-hospital mortality and critical events at time windows of 3, 5, 7, and 10 days from admission. Our study population included harmonized EHR data from five hospitals in New York City for 4098 COVID-19–positive patients admitted from March 15 to May 22, 2020. The models were first trained on patients from a single hospital (n=1514) before or on May 1, externally validated on patients from four other hospitals (n=2201) before or on May 1, and prospectively validated on all patients after May 1 (n=383). Finally, we established model interpretability to identify and rank variables that drive model predictions. RESULTS: Upon cross-validation, the XGBoost classifier outperformed baseline models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for mortality of 0.89 at 3 days, 0.85 at 5 and 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days. XGBoost also performed well for critical event prediction, with an AUC-ROC of 0.80 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days. In external validation, XGBoost achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.88 at 3 days, 0.86 at 5 days, 0.86 at 7 days, and 0.84 at 10 days for mortality prediction. Similarly, the unimputed XGBoost model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.78 at 3 days, 0.79 at 5 days, 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.81 at 10 days. Trends in performance on prospective validation sets were similar. At 7 days, acute kidney injury on admission, elevated LDH, tachypnea, and hyperglycemia were the strongest drivers of critical event prediction, while higher age, anion gap, and C-reactive protein were the strongest drivers of mortality prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We externally and prospectively trained and validated machine learning models for mortality and critical events for patients with COVID-19 at different time horizons. These models identified at-risk patients and uncovered underlying relationships that predicted outcomes."

Intraoperative radiotherapy for early breast cancer — insufficient evidence to change practice,"We argue that the evidence remains insufficient for use of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in women with early stage breast cancer outside of a clinical trial, as the recently reported TARGIT-A trial does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that IORT is superior to no radiotherapy."
Urban health nexus with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) preparedness and response in Africa: Rapid scoping review of the early evidence,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 also called coronavirus disease 2019 was first reported in the African continent on 14 February 2020 in Egypt. As at 18 December 2020, the continent reported 2,449,754 confirmed cases, 57,817 deaths and 2,073,214 recoveries. Urban cities in Africa have particularly suffered the brunt of coronavirus disease 2019 coupled with criticisms that the response strategies have largely been a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. This article reviewed early evidence on urban health nexus with coronavirus disease 2019 preparedness and response in Africa. METHODS: A rapid scoping review of empirical and grey literature was done using data sources such as ScienceDirect, GoogleScholar, PubMed, HINARI and official websites of World Health Organization and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 26 full articles (empirical studies, reviews and commentaries) were synthesised and analysed qualitatively based on predefined inclusion criteria on publication relevance and quality. RESULTS: Over 70% of the 26 articles reported on coronavirus disease 2019 response strategies across Africa; 27% of the articles reported on preparedness towards coronavirus disease 2019, while 38% reported on urbanisation nexus with coronavirus disease 2019; 40% of the publications were full-text empirical studies, while the remaining 60% were either commentaries, reviews or editorials. It was found that urban cities remain epicentres of coronavirus disease 2019 in Africa. Even though some successes have been recorded in Africa regarding coronavirus disease 2019 fight, the continent’s response strategies were largely found to be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. Consequently, adoption of ‘Western elitist’ mitigating measures for coronavirus disease 2019 containment resulted in excesses and spillover effects on individuals, families and economies in Africa. CONCLUSION: Africa needs to increase commitment to health systems strengthening through context-specific interventions and prioritisation of pandemic preparedness over response. Likewise, improved economic resilience and proper urban planning will help African countries to respond better to future public health emergencies, as coronavirus disease 2019 cases continue to surge on the continent."
Differences in clinical characteristics between younger and older patients with COVID-19 and their relationship with the length of hospital stay,"Background : The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently threatening the health of individuals worldwide. We compared the clinical characteristics between younger patients (aged <60 years) and older patients (aged ≥60 years) with COVID-19, detected the risk factors associated with a prolonged hospital stay, and examined the treatments commonly used with a particular focus on antiviral therapies. Methods : This retrospective study was conducted at the West Campus, Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). The sample consisted of 123 patients admitted to the hospital between February 9, 2020, and March 3, 2020. The data related to the demographics, laboratory findings, and treatment were analyzed to identify discrepancies between younger and older patients and those with and without primary diseases. The risk factors that contribute to a prolonged hospital stay were subsequently identified. Results : Patients aged ≥60 years required longer hospital stay than younger patients (P = 0.021 and P = 0.001, respectively). The percentage of lymphocytes was significantly lower in older patients and those with primary diseases (P = 0.016 and P = 0.042, respectively). The findings revealed that the risk factors that contributed to the length of hospital stay were age, the number of days of illness before hospitalization, white blood cell (WBC) count and albumin levels at admission, a neutrophil fraction at discharge, and antibiotic treatment. Analysis using a model that consisted of the above five risk factors for predicting prolonged hospital stay (i.e., >14 days) yielded an area under the ROC (AuROC) curve of 0.716. Antiviral and antibiotic treatments were administered to 97.6% and 39.0% of patients, respectively. The antiviral drugs most commonly administered were traditional Chinese medicine (83.7%) and arbidol (75.6%). Conclusions : In this study, older patients and those with primary diseases were at a higher risk of worse clinical manifestations. The physicians who treat the patients should pay close attention to the risk factors that contribute to the length of hospital stay, which could be used for predicting prolonged hospital stay. Traditional Chinese medicine and arbidol were the most frequently used antiviral drugs. Nevertheless, the extent to which these medications can effectively treat COVID-19 warrants further investigation."
COVID-19 in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease,"BACKGROUND: Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) have been considered potentially high risk for novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) mortality or other complications. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to define the impact of COVID-19 in adults with CHD and to identify risk factors associated with adverse outcomes. METHODS: Adults (age 18 years or older) with CHD and with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 were included from CHD centers worldwide. Data collection included anatomic diagnosis and subsequent interventions, comorbidities, medications, echocardiographic findings, presenting symptoms, course of illness, and outcomes. Predictors of death or severe infection were determined. RESULTS: From 58 adult CHD centers, the study included 1,044 infected patients (age: 35.1 ± 13.0 years; range 18 to 86 years; 51% women), 87% of whom had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection. The cohort included 118 (11%) patients with single ventricle and/or Fontan physiology, 87 (8%) patients with cyanosis, and 73 (7%) patients with pulmonary hypertension. There were 24 COVID-related deaths (case/fatality: 2.3%; 95% confidence interval: 1.4% to 3.2%). Factors associated with death included male sex, diabetes, cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency, and previous hospital admission for heart failure. Worse physiological stage was associated with mortality (p = 0.001), whereas anatomic complexity or defect group were not. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mortality in adults with CHD is commensurate with the general population. The most vulnerable patients are those with worse physiological stage, such as cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension, whereas anatomic complexity does not appear to predict infection severity."
Factors influencing social distancing to prevent the community spread of COVID-19 among Chinese adults,"The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020 has been an international public health threat. Early strong social distancing efforts is needed to stop transmission of the virus. The purpose of the present study is to identify individual and environmental factors related to individuals' compliance with the recommended social distancing, as well as the moderating role of social media in influencing individuals' implementation of social distancing. A total of 2130 Chinese adults were surveyed in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses were performed to ascertain the predictors of social distancing. Overall, the majority of respondents (95.6%) reported compliance with social distancing. Women were more likely to practice social distancing compared to men (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.93–5.02). Psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and social media were significant predictors of social distancing after controlling for other individual and environmental factors. Social media moderated the effects of psychological distress on social distancing (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94–0.99). Findings from the study indicates that mental health status and social media are influential factors of social distancing, which have significant implications in enhancing the effectiveness of prevention strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19."
Time trends in social contacts before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: the CONNECT study,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries, including Canada, have adopted unprecedented physical distancing measures such as closure of schools and non-essential businesses, and restrictions on gatherings and household visits. We described time trends in social contacts for the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods in Quebec, Canada. METHODS: CONNECT is a population-based study of social contacts conducted shortly before (2018/2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020 – February 2021), using the same methodology for both periods. We recruited participants by random digit dialing and collected data by self-administered web-based questionnaires. Questionnaires documented socio-demographic characteristics and social contacts for two assigned days. A contact was defined as a two-way conversation at a distance ≤ 2 m or as a physical contact, irrespective of masking. We used weighted generalized linear models with a Poisson distribution and robust variance (taking possible overdispersion into account) to compare the mean number of social contacts over time and by socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 1291 and 5516 Quebecers completed the study before and during the pandemic, respectively. Contacts significantly decreased from a mean of 8 contacts/day prior to the pandemic to 3 contacts/day during the spring 2020 lockdown. Contacts remained lower than the pre-COVID period thereafter (lowest = 3 contacts/day during the Christmas 2020/2021 holidays, highest = 5 in September 2020). Contacts at work, during leisure activities/in other locations, and at home with visitors showed the greatest decreases since the beginning of the pandemic. All sociodemographic subgroups showed significant decreases of contacts since the beginning of the pandemic. The mixing matrices illustrated the impact of public health measures (e.g. school closure, gathering restrictions) with fewer contacts between children/teenagers and fewer contacts outside of the three main diagonals of contacts between same-age partners/siblings and between children and their parents. CONCLUSION: Physical distancing measures in Quebec significantly decreased social contacts, which most likely mitigated the spread of COVID-19.

Preliminary investigation on feline coronavirus presence in the reproductive tract of the tom cat as a potential route of viral transmission,"OBJECTIVES: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated disease initiated by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. To date, the only proven route of transmission is the faecal–oral route, but a possible localisation of FCoV in the reproductive tract of tom cats is of concern, owing to the involvement of the male reproductive tract during FIP and to the presence of reproduction disorders in FCoV-endemic feline catteries. The aim of the study was to investigate the presence and localisation of FCoV in semen and/or in the reproductive tract of tom cats, and its possible association with seroconversion and viraemic phase. METHODS: Blood, serum, semen and/or testicle samples were obtained from 46 tom cats. Serology was performed on 38 serum samples, nested reverse transcriptase PCR (nRT-PCR) and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were performed on 39 blood samples and on 17 semen samples, and histology, immunohistochemistry and nRT-PCR were performed on 39 testicles. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 38 serum samples were positive on serology. Semen samples were negative on RT-PCR and RT-qPCR for FCoV, while all blood samples were negative at both molecular methods, except for one sample positive at RT-qPCR with a very low viral load. All testicles were negative at immunohistochemistry, while six were positive at nRT-PCR for FCoV. Serology and blood PCR results suggest that the virus was present in the environment, stimulating transient seroconversion. FCoV seems not to localise in the semen of tom cats, making the venereal route as a way of transmission unlikely. Although viral RNA was found in some testicles, it could not be correlated with the viraemic phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the light of these preliminary results, artificial insemination appears safer than natural mating as it eliminates the direct contact between animals, thus diminishing the probability of faecal–oral FCoV transmission."

Role of extended hemodialysis in COVID-19: a case report,
Médicaments biosimilaires: Enjeux réglementaires et impacts médico-économiques,"Résumé Le concept de médicament biosimilaire a été lancé par les directives européennes de 2001 et 2004 avec les premières autorisations européennes de mise sur le marché (AMM) délivrées en 2006. Ce sont des « copies » de médicaments biologiques, pour la plupart des protéines. Compte tenu de la variabilité inhérente aux processus de « synthèse biologique » quelques variations de la structure chimique du produit fini peuvent être observées sur les résidus glycosylés mais pas sur la séquence d’acides aminés pour les protéines. Pour cette raison, le dossier de demande d’AMM de ces produits, contrairement aux génériques, doit comporter une démonstration d’équivalence thérapeutique dans au moins l’une des indications thérapeutiques du princeps. C’est l’arrivée des biosimilaires des anticorps monoclonaux qui a vraiment marqué leur avènement avec les biosimilaires d’infliximab, d’etanercept et d’adalimumab dans les domaines de la rhumatologie, gastro-entérologie et dermatologie, puis dans les domaines de la cancérologie avec les biosimilaires de rituximab, trastuzumab et enfin bévacizumab. Si l’arrivée des biosimilaires réduit le risque de ruptures d’approvisionnement des produits princeps, leur intérêt est principalement économique, permettant la réduction du prix des traitements face aux princeps biologiques coûteux. Avec l’expérience acquise, les réticences à l’interchangeabilité des produits se sont estompées. Abstract The concept of biosimilar medicine was launched by 2001 and 2004 European Directives. First European marketing authorizations were delivered in 2006. They are “copies” of biologically manufactured medicines, mostly proteins. Taking into account the intrinsic variability related to the biological manufacture process, some variation of the chemical structure of the finished compound may be observed. They impact especially the glycosylation residues but not the amino-acid sequence (for proteins). For this reason, the marketing authorization application dossier has to involve, as opposed to the generic medicine procedure, the demonstration of the therapeutic equivalence in at least one clinical indication of the princeps medicine."
Zika virus amid COVID-19 in India: A rising concern,
Long-Term Clinical Outcome and Prognosis After Thrombectomy in Patients With Concomitant Malignancy,"Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is the preferred treatment strategy for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, clinical outcome and prognosis in patients who undergo EVT in response to AIS with concomitant malignancy have not been fully elucidated. Data of patients with malignancy who underwent EVT at participating institutions between January 2015 and April 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patient characteristics, treatment methods, posttreatment strategy, and long-term prognosis were evaluated in 12 patients with prediagnoses of malignancy. Good revascularization (TICI 2b or higher) was achieved in 10 of 12 patients. Among the eight patients who survived more than 2 weeks from onset, four patients showed good clinical outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <2] at 60 days posttreatment and were able to continue treatment for malignancy. However, seven of eight patients died within a year of EVT (median survival, 83 days) due to progression of malignancy. One-year survival was achieved in only one patient whose etiology of stroke was determined as infectious endocarditis and not Trousseau syndrome. Even after successful revascularization and good short-term clinical outcome, the long-term prognosis after thrombectomy in patients with malignancy was poor. Thrombectomy for concomitant malignancy requires judicious decision, and further studies are necessary to fully elucidate its efficacy."
Neuroradiologic Imaging of Neurologic and Neuro-Ophthalmic Complications of Coronavirus-19 Infection,"To review the literature and provide a summary of COVID-19–related neurologic and neuro-ophthalmic complications. METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed on PubMed and Google Scholar using the following keywords for searches: CNS, Neuro-Ophthalmology, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, optic neuritis, pseudotumor cerebri, Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), meningitis, encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and Guillain–Barré and Miller Fisher syndromes. RESULTS: Neuroradiologic findings of neurologic and neuro-ophthalmologic complications in relationship to COVID-19 infection were reviewed. Afferent visual pathway–related disorders with relevant imaging manifestations included fundus nodules on MRI, papilledema and pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, optic neuritis, Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, vascular injury with thromboembolism and infarct, leukoencephalopathy, gray matter hypoxic injury, hemorrhage, infectious meningitis/encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and PRES. Efferent visual pathway–related complications with relevant imaging manifestations were also reviewed, including orbital abnormalities, cranial neuropathy, Guillain–Barré and Miller Fisher syndromes, and nystagmus and other eye movement abnormalities related to rhombencephalitis. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can cause central and peripheral nervous system disease, including along both the afferent and efferent components of visual axis. Manifestations of disease and long-term sequela continue to be studied and described. Familiarity with the wide variety of neurologic, ophthalmic, and neuroradiologic presentations can promote prompt and appropriate treatment and continue building a framework to understand the underlying mechanism of disease."
Non-intubated COVID-19 patients despite high levels of supplemental oxygen,
Wide spectrum of clinical picture of COVID-19 in children - from mild to severe disease,"INTRODUCTION: Children account for a relatively small proportion of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. In children, COVID-19 usually has a relatively mild course. However, in rare cases, severe disorders can be observed, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to analyse the frequency, clinical picture and outcome of COVID-19 in children based on the experience from the tertiary care centre and regional sanitary-epidemiological office. METHODS: We report a study regarding 106 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab (age range 1-month – 17-years). In all cases, history was taken. In children who required hospital admission, physical examination and laboratory test were performed according to clinical indications. RESULTS: Twelve of the patients required admission to the hospital. The most common symptoms were anosmia and dysgeusia (75%) and headaches (49%) in outpatients and fever in hospitalised children (75%). Three children from the hospitalised group developed a severe course with increased inflammatory indexes. The clinical picture was more severe in younger children from the hospitalised group. Treatment options were regarded individually in all cases. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first tour knowledge regarding the clinical course of COVID-19 in Polish children. In general, the clinical course of COVID-19 was mild with anosmia and dysgeusia as the most common symptoms. However, in hospitalised children, a severe progression of the disease and less typical signs as aplastic anaemia may be developed."

CXCL12-driven thymocyte migration is increased by thymic epithelial cells treated with prolactin in vitro,"The prolactin hormone (PRL), in addition to its known effects on breast development and lactation, exerts effects on the immune system, including pleiotropic effects on the thymus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of PRL on the epithelial compartment of the thymus. Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) (2BH4 cells) and fresh thymocytes were used. Immunofluorescence assay revealed that PRL treatment (10 ng/mL) increases the deposition of laminin and expression of the chemokine CXCL12 in 2BH4 cells. However, no change was observed in the deposition of fibronectin. Moreover, PRL altered F-actin polymerisation, allowing the formation of focal adhesion complexes in treated cells. When 2BH4 cells were pre-treated with PRL, thymocyte adhesion was not altered. However, in the cell migration assay, pre-treatment with PRL potentiated the chemotactic effect of CXCL12 on the migration of total, double-positive, CD4-positive, and CD8-positive thymocytes. Together, the results of this study demonstrate the effect of PRL on thymic epithelial cells, particularly on CXCL12-driven thymocyte migration, confirming that this hormone is a regulator of thymic physiology."
The efficacy and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The global total of COVID-19 cases will reach 20 million this week, with 750,000 deaths. It has spread to more than 200 countries and regions around the world. At present, the global pandemic continues to rise and continues to spread worldwide. It is necessary to explore the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19 as soon as possible. Remdesiviras was an antiviral agent with therapeutic potential, but it was still controversial. Objective: Through systematic review and meta-analysis, to evaluate the effect and safety of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and will provide a reliable reference for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: We used the following search string: ""COVID-19"" [Mesh], ""remdesivir"" [Mesh], ""randomized controlled trial"" [Mesh]. We used the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and corresponding keywords to make the search strategy. We searched six databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trials.gov and chictr.org.cn. Data analyses were conducted by using the software Review Manager 5.3 and STATA version 14.0. Results: Our systematic search identified 5 meta-analyses of RCTs, including 1782 patients with COVID-19.The clinical improvement of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 was superior to the placebo-controlled group (relative risk (RR) =1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.29, p= 0.0009). The following are the Single-Arm Study, Meta-analysis results. The pooled prevalence of clinical improvement significant findings was 62% (95% CI = 59-65%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir. The incidence rates of Acute kidney injury ,Hepatic enzyme increased , Any serious adverse event were 5% (95%CI=3-7%, p=0.00), 11%(95%CI=5-16%, p=0.00), 22%(95%CI=18-27%, p =0.00), respectively, and the mortality was 13%(95%CI=8-19%, p=0.00), during treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir. Conclusion: This analysis confirms that remdesivir is effective in the clinical improvement of COVID-19 patients, and the rate of clinical improvement was 62%. In addition, adverse events and mortality should also be paid attention to. Future research should aim that more large-scale studies were needed to confirm the results, to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms."
Interferons and viruses: Signaling for supremacy,"Interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β are critical mediators of host defense against microbial challenges, directly interfering with viral infection and influencing both the innate and adaptive immune responses. IFNs exert their effects in target cells through the activation of a cell-surface receptor, leading to a cascade of signaling events that determine transcriptional and translation regulation. Understanding the circuitry associated with IFN-mediated signal transduction that leads to a specific biological outcome has been a major focus of our laboratory. Through the efforts of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, a skilled research technologist, and important collaborations with investigators elsewhere, we have provided some insights into the complexity of the IFN system—and the elegance and simplicity of how protein-protein interactions define biological function."
Modelling of Reproduction number for COVID-19 in India and high incidence states,
The Multifaceted Role of Flavonoids in Cancer Therapy: Leveraging Autophagy with a Double-Edged Sword,"Flavonoids are considered as pleiotropic, safe, and readily obtainable molecules. A large number of recent studies have proposed that flavonoids have potential in the treatment of tumors by the modulation of autophagy. In many cases, flavonoids suppress cancer by stimulating excessive autophagy or impairing autophagy flux especially in apoptosis-resistant cancer cells. However, the anti-cancer activity of flavonoids may be attenuated due to the simultaneous induction of protective autophagy. Notably, flavonoids-triggered protective autophagy is becoming a trend for preventing cancer in the clinical setting or for protecting patients from conventional therapeutic side effects in normal tissues. In this review, focusing on the underlying autophagic mechanisms of flavonoids, we hope to provide a new perspective for clinical application of flavonoids in cancer therapy. In addition, we highlight new research ideas for the development of new dosage forms of flavonoids to improve their various pharmacological effects, establishing flavonoids as ideal candidates for cancer prevention and therapy in the clinic."
Survival of covid-19 patients requires precise immune regulation: the hypothetical immunoprotective role of nicotinic agonists,Summary recent studies have provided novel evidence regarding the effect of nicotine agonists on the prevention or modulation of cytokines storm and reduction of infection. In this study we tried to attempt to address these issues from a therapeutic perspective of nicotine agonists in this manner and we describe one of the most challenging theories of immunotherapy in coronavirus-19 (COV-19). The analysis of the proposed mechanism goes beyond the physiological consequences of a way to design new strategies to provide anti-inflammatory drugs.
Percutaneous intravenous catheter forceps biopsy in right atrial mass: two case reports and literature review,"BACKGROUND: Primary malignant tumors of the heart are rare. Although preoperative histological diagnosis is difficult, it has paramount value in therapeutic strategy development and prognostic estimation. Herein, we reported 2 cases of intracardiac tumors. CASES PRESENTATION: Both patients presented to the hospital with heart-related symptoms. Echocardiography showed massive masses in the atrium and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed hypermetabolism and invasiveness. One patient cannot take surgery due to extensive metastasis and poor condition. The other patient was primarily diagnosed with lymphoma, and surgery was not recommended. They successfully underwent intravenous atrial biopsy, and histological samples confirmed intimal sarcoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Based on immunohistochemical and molecular assessments, targeted chemotherapy was administered, resulting in clinical and imaging remission at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous intravenous catheter biopsy as a safe invasive test provides an accurate pathological diagnosis after imaging evaluation, and offers a therapeutic direction. Nonmalignant masses and some chemo-radiosensitive malignant tumors in the atrium could have good prognosis after targeted therapy."
To assess whether a “virtual admission” can be useful for Parkinson’s disease patients with severe motor fluctuations,
"A nationwide study of the incidence, prevalence and mortality of Parkinson’s disease in the Norwegian population","Epidemiological studies of Parkinson’s disease (PD) show variable and partially conflicting findings with regard to incidence, prevalence, and mortality. These differences are commonly attributed to technical and methodological factors, including small sample sizes, differences in diagnostic practices, and population heterogeneity. We leveraged the Norwegian Prescription Database, a population-based registry of drug prescriptions dispensed from Norwegian pharmacies to assess the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of PD in Norway. The diagnosis of PD was defined based on the prescription of dopaminergic drugs for the indication of PD over a continuous time. During 2004–2017, 12,229 males and 9831 females met our definition for PD diagnosis. PD prevalence increased over the observation period, with larger changes observed in the older age groups. Incidence and prevalence of PD increased with age, peaking at 85 years. The male/female prevalence ratio was 1.5 across all ages, whereas the incidence ratio increased with age, from 1.4 in those 60 years, to 2.03 among those >90 years. While PD mortality was generally higher than that of the general population, mortality odds ratios decreased with age, approaching 1.0 among individuals >90 years old. When adjusted for the sex-specific mortality of the general population, the mortality among females with PD was equal to or higher than the mortality among males with PD. Our findings demonstrate that the epidemiological features of PD, including sex-differences, are age and time-period dependent and indicate that sex differences in PD mortality are unlikely to stem from disease-specific negative impact of survival in males."
Immune Correlates Analysis of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trial,"BACKGROUND: In the Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) trial, estimated mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was 94%. SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements were assessed as correlates of COVID-19 risk and as correlates of protection. METHODS: Through case-cohort sampling, participants were selected for measurement of four serum antibody markers at Day 1 (first dose), Day 29 (second dose), and Day 57: IgG binding antibodies (bAbs) to Spike, bAbs to Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), and 50% and 80% inhibitory dilution pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers calibrated to the WHO International Standard (cID50 and cID80). Participants with no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cox regression assessed in vaccine recipients the association of each Day 29 or 57 serologic marker with COVID-19 through 126 or 100 days of follow-up, respectively, adjusting for risk factors. RESULTS: Day 57 Spike IgG, RBD IgG, cID50, and cID80 neutralization levels were each inversely correlated with risk of COVID-19: hazard ratios 0.66 (95% CI 0.50, 0.88; p=0.005); 0.57 (0.40, 0.82; p=0.002); 0.42 (0.27, 0.65; p<0.001); 0.35 (0.20, 0.61; p<0.001) per 10-fold increase in marker level, respectively, multiplicity adjusted P-values 0.003–0.010. Results were similar for Day 29 markers (multiplicity adjusted P-values <0.001–0.003). For vaccine recipients with Day 57 reciprocal cID50 neutralization titers that were undetectable (<2.42), 100, or 1000, respectively, cumulative incidence of COVID-19 through 100 days post Day 57 was 0.030 (0.010, 0.093), 0.0056 (0.0039, 0.0080), and 0.0023 (0.0013, 0.0036). For vaccine recipients at these titer levels, respectively, vaccine efficacy was 50.8% (−51.2, 83.0%), 90.7% (86.7, 93.6%), and 96.1% (94.0, 97.8%). Causal mediation analysis estimated that the proportion of vaccine efficacy mediated through Day 29 cID50 titer was 68.5% (58.5, 78.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Binding and neutralizing antibodies correlated with COVID-19 risk and vaccine efficacy and likely have utility in predicting mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against COVID-19.

Group testing performance evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 massive scale screening and testing,"BACKGROUND: The capacity of the current molecular testing convention does not allow high-throughput and community level scans of COVID-19 infections. The diameter in the current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. METHODS: We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. RESULTS: Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 15X-20X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. CONCLUSION: Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to conventional group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly."
Innovative diagnostic approach and investigation trends in COVID19-A systematic review,"A highly contagious viral infection emerged in Wuhan city; China had increased mortality with uncertain pathogenesis spreads throughout the world to become a pandemic. It is reported to be caused by a member of β coronaviruses and named it as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease is caused by a mutant strain of coronavirus SARS-COV-2 that affects the respiratory tract causing mild to severe respiratory tract illness. The clinical manifestation ranges from mild, moderate, severe and very severe signs and symptoms result in death due to severe hypoxia or multi-organ dysfunction. Also, the affected persons were capable of infecting others through various modes of transmission through respiratory droplets (aerosol spread). A definite investigation protocol has followed to diagnose COVID 19 disease but mainly confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Computerized tomography scan plays a significant role in the diagnosis and prognosis of affected individuals. The major problem with COVID-19 is due to its novelty and lack of vaccination or treatment. This review focuses on the mutation, pathogenesis, various diagnostic tests adopted and autopsy findings in patients affected with COVID-19."
Crosslink bio-adhesives for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction: current status and future direction,"Several bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) treatments have been developed to reduce hyperinflation in emphysema patients. Lung bio-adhesives are among the most promising new BLVR treatment options, as they potentially provide a permanent solution for emphysematous patients after only a single application. To date, bio-adhesives have mainly been used as haemostats and tissue sealants, while their application in permanently contracting and sealing hyperinflated lung tissue has recently been identified as a novel and enticing opportunity. However, a major drawback of the current adhesive technology is the induction of severe inflammatory responses and adverse events upon administration. In our review, we distinguish between and discuss various natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic tissue haemostats and sealants that have been used for pulmonary applications such as sealing air/fluid leaks. Furthermore, we present an overview of the different materials including AeriSeal and autologous blood that have been used to achieve lung volume reduction and discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks. In conclusion, we describe the key biological (therapeutic benefit and biocompatibility) and biomechanical (degradability, adhesive strength, stiffness, viscoelasticity, tunability and self-healing capacity) characteristics that are essential for an ideal lung bio-adhesive material with the potential to overcome the concerns related to current adhesives."
Forecasting COVID-19 new cases using deep learning methods,"After nearly two years since the first identification of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the surge in cases because of virus mutations is a cause of grave public health concern across the globe. As a result of this health crisis, predicting the transmission pattern of the virus is one of the most vital tasks for preparing and controlling the pandemic. In addition to mathematical models, machine learning tools, especially deep learning models have been developed for forecasting the trend of the number of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 with great success. In this paper, three deep learning models, including CNN, LSTM, and the CNN-LSTM have been developed to predict the number of COVID-19 cases for Brazil, India and Russia. We also compare the performance of our models with the previously developed deep learning models and notice significant improvements in prediction performance. Although our models have been used only for forecasting cases in these three countries, the models can be easily applied to datasets of other countries. Among the models developed in this work, the LSTM model has the highest performance when forecasting and shows an improvement in the forecasting accuracy compared with some existing models. The research will enable accurate forecasting of the COVID-19 cases and support the global fight against the pandemic."
Improving Informed Consent for Novel Vaccine Research in a Pediatric Hospital Setting Using a Blended Research-Design Approach,"It is necessary to conduct Clinical Trials in children, including for novel vaccines. Children cannot legally provide valid consent, but can assent to research participation. Informed consent and assent communications are frequently criticized for their lack of comprehensibility and often, researchers do not involve patients in informed consent design. We tested a blended research-design approach to co-design multimedia informed consent prototypes for experimental vaccine studies targeted at the pediatric population. We report details on the methodology utilized, and the insights, ideas, and prototype solutions we generated using social media data analysis, a survey, and workshops. A survey of clinical trial researchers indicated that while the most did not use technology for informed consent, they considered its utilization favorable. Social media analysis enabled researchers to quickly understand where community perspectives were concordant and discordant and build their understanding of the types of topics that they may want to focus on during the design workshops. Participatory design workshops for children and their families reaped insights, ideas, and prototypes for a range of tools including apps and websites. Participants felt that the prototypes were better able to communicate necessary content than the original text document format. We propose using a participatory, mixed-methods approach to design informed consent so that it is better adapted to patients' needs. Such an approach would be helpful in better addressing the needs of different segments of the populations involved in clinical trials. Further evidence should be gained about the impact of this strategy in improving recruitment, decreasing withdrawals and litigations, and improving patient satisfaction during clinical trials."
Big data-drive agent-based modeling of online polarized opinions,"Under the mobile internet and big data era, more and more people are discussing and interacting online with each other. The forming process and evolutionary dynamics of public opinions online have been heavily investigated. Using agent-based modeling, we expand the Ising model to explore how individuals behave and the evolutionary mechanism of the life cycles. The big data platform of Douban.com is selected as the data source, and the online case “NeiYuanWaiFang” is applied as the real target, for our modeling and simulations to match. We run 10,000 simulations to find possible optimal solutions, and we run 10,000 times again to check the robustness and adaptability. The optimal solution simulations can reflect the whole life cycle process. In terms of different levels and indicators, the fitting or matching degrees achieve the highest levels. At the micro-level, the distributions of individual behaviors under real case and simulations are similar to each other, and they all follow normal distributions; at the middle-level, both discrete and continuous distributions of supportive and oppositive online comments are matched between real case and simulations; at the macro-level, the life cycle process (outbreak, rising, peak, and vanish) and durations can be well matched. Therefore, our model has properly seized the core mechanism of individual behaviors, and precisely simulated the evolutionary dynamics of online cases in reality."
Detection of Respiratory Viruses in Nasopharyngeal Swab and Adenoid Tissue from Children Submitted to Adenoidectomy: Pre- and Postoperative Analysis,"Introduction The presence of respiratory viruses in lymphoid tissues of the nasopharynx and oropharynx and its impact on recurrent infections and hypertrophy of these tissues are not yet fully understood. Objective To identify and determine the prevalence of major respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions and adenoid tissue pre- and postoperatively of children undergoing adenoidectomy. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in 36 patients under 12 years of age with upper airway lymphoid hypertrophy who were undergoing adenoidectomy, in which various respiratory viruses were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction in adenoid tissue and nasopharyngeal secretions collected preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively. Results At least 1 viral agent was isolated in any of the samples collected in 58.3% of children and 25.9% of total samples. Respiratory viruses were identified in 33.8% of preoperative nasopharyngeal specimens and in 19.8% of postoperative secretion. Of the 21 patients with positive results for any respiratory virus, 6 (28.6%) had more than 1 virus. Considering all 36 respiratory viruses found, the main agent isolated was rhinovirus (27.8%), followed by bocavirus (22.2%). Conclusion The virus found more frequently in all samples was rhinovirus. After removal of adenoid tissue, there was a decrease in the prevalence of the virus contained in nasopharyngeal secretion 30 days after surgery."
Ignored and invisible: internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the face of COVID-19 pandemic,"COVID-19 is impacting the whole world. The impacts are different on different countries and societal groups, and those who are poor, mobile, and displaced are disproportionally affected. There are different ways that they are affected: they are more vulnerable to contracting the disease while living in shelter, have many barriers to access to social services and health care, difficulty in accessing relief and aid, prone to livelihood loss, and financial insecurity."
Burnout and Quality of Life in Professionals Working in Nursing Homes: The Moderating Effect of Stereotypes,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyse how stereotypes towards older people moderate the relationship between burnout and quality of life (QoL) of professionals working in nursing homes. METHOD: A total of 312 professionals were asked to complete questionnaires of burnout Maslach Burnout Inventory quality of Life (QPL-35) and aging stereotypes (CENVE). The moderation effects were tested using linear regression models. RESULTS: A negative association was observed between burnout and QoL. It was also found a statistically significant moderator effect of the total score of stereotypes and the health stereotypes, besides a marginally statistically significant moderator effect for motivational stereotypes. The moderator effects were different for people with low and high negative stereotypes. QoL was more affected under conditions of high burnout, in which people with more negative stereotypes tended to present higher QoL than people with lower negative stereotypes. CONCLUSION: Highly burned-out professionals in nursing homes may avoid their negative feelings projecting them to residents through stereotypes, as a way of coping with burnout and increasing their QoL. However, this mechanism is an “aggressive reaction” and may have negative effects for both the older adult and the professional. The comprehension of these variables is essential for developing adequate intervention programs."
Volatile Compound Characterization of Coffee (Coffea arabica) Processed at Different Fermentation Times Using SPME-GC-MS,"Coffee is a beverage that is consumed due to its flavor and fragrance. In this investigation, we demonstrated the relations between different dry fermentation processes of coffee (aerobic, anaerobic, and atmosphere modified with CO2) and fermentation times (0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h), with pH, acidity, and seven volatile marker compounds of coffee. Volatile compounds were extracted by solid phase microextraction (SPME) and an analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A significant effect (p < 0.05) between the fermentation time and a decrease in pH was demonstrated, as well as between the fermentation time and increasing acidity (p < 0.05). Acetic acid was positively correlated with the fermentation time, unlike 2-methylpyrazine, 2-furanmethanol, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, and 5-methylfurfural, which were negatively correlated with the fermentation time. The aerobic and anaerobic fermentation treatments obtained high affinity with the seven volatile marker compounds analyzed due to the optimal environment for the development of the microorganisms that acted in this process. In contrast, in the fermentation process in an atmosphere modified with CO2, a negative affinity with the seven volatile compounds was evidenced, because this gas inactivated the development of microorganisms and inhibited their activity in the fermentation process."
"Effect of Dietary L-Threonine and Toxin Binder on Performance, Blood Parameters, and Immune Response of Broilers Exposed to Aflatoxin B1.","To evaluate the effect of L-Threonine (L-Thr) and Mycofix® Plus (MP) on aflatoxicosis, an experiment with a 3-way ANOVA model was carried out with 8 replicates and 640 birds. Treatments included two levels of L-Thr (100% and 125% of the requirements, Cobb 500, Cobb-Vantress), Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) (0, 500 ppb), and MP (0, 1 g/kg). As the main effects showed, AFB1 decreased breast meat yield and carcass percentage (p < 0.001), serum urea, antibody titer against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and bone density (p < 0.05), while it increased the plasma concentrations of glucose and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p < 0.05). Mycofix Plus improved the grower feed intake (FI), tibia fresh weight, and body weight (BW) to bone weight (p < 0.05). L-Threonine increased the grower FI, breast meat yield, serum aspartate transaminase (AST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (p < 0.05). There were positive interactions with breast meat yield, cholesterol, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and IBV titer. Of the treatments used, the combination of L-Thr and MP without AFB1 improved breast meat and carcass percentage. L-Threonine and MP significantly improved IBV titer in birds challenged with AFB1 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, L-Thr and MP were beneficial to improve immunity."
Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) complicated with pneumonia in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis receiving conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs,"In December 2019, numerous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were reported in Wuhan, China, which has since spread throughout the world. However, its impact on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is unknown. Herein, we report a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a 61-year-old female RA patient who was receiving conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs). The patient presented with a 4-day history of myalgia and febrile sensation. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray showed increased opacity on the right lower lung area, and C-reactive protein level was slightly elevated. The patient was treated with antiviral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), and treatment with cDMARDs was discontinued except hydroxychloroquine. Her symptoms and laboratory results gradually improved. Three weeks later, real-time PCR for COVID-19 showed negative conversion, and the patient was discharged without any complications."
Practice of Family-centred Care in Intensive Care Units before the COVID-19-Pandemic: a cross-sectional analysis in German-speaking countries,"OBJECTIVES: To provide insights into visiting policies and family-centred care practices with a focus on children as visitors in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in German-speaking countries. METHODS/ DESIGN: Online-survey with a mixed approach were used. Leading clinicians (n=1,943) from German-speaking countries were invited to participate. Outcomes included the percentage of ICUs with open visiting policies, age restrictions, family-centred care activities and barriers. SETTING: Paediatric, mixed and adult ICUs. RESULTS: In total, 19.8% (n=385) of the clinicians responded. Open visiting times were reported by 36.3% (n=117), with significant differences between paediatric (79.2%), adult (21.3%) and mixed-age (41.2%) ICUs (p<001). Two-thirds of clinicians stated that their ICUs had no age restrictions for visiting children as visitors (n=221, 68.4%). The family-centred care activities most frequently implemented were open visiting times and dissemination of information. Significantly more German ICUs have open visiting policies and more Swiss ICUs allow children as visitors, compared to the other countries (both p<0.001). Barriers to family-centred care were concerns about children being traumatized, infection and workload. CONCLUSION: The majority reported that family-centred care policies had been implemented in their ICUs, including open visiting policies, allowing children as visitors without age restriction and other family-centred care activities."
Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Application Using Hydantoin Acrylamide for Biocidal Functionalization of Polyester,"Biocidal functionalization in polyester fibers is a really tough challenge because of the lack of tethering groups. This study indicated supercritical carbon dioxide application using N-halamine would be an alternative solution for obtaining antibacterial function on the polyester surface. Firstly, N-(2-methyl-1-(4-methyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-4 yl)propan-2 yl)acrylamide was synthesized and applied to the polyester in supercritical carbon dioxide medium, at 120 °C, 30 MPa for different processing times. The addition of N-halamine on the surface significantly brought antibacterial activity against E. coli. The chlorine loadings showed that 6 -h exposure time was critical to obtain sufficient antibacterial activity. This treatment caused a reasonable and tolerable loss in color and mechanical properties. But, the durability to abrasion, stability, and rechargeability of oxidative chlorine, and the durability of N-halamine on the surface were remarkably good. Conclusively, it can be available to work on polyester surfaces with resource-efficient and eco-friendly supercritical carbon dioxide technique for getting more functionalization and modification."
Densovirus Oil Suspension Significantly Improves the Efficacy and Duration of Larvicidal Activity against Aedes albopictus,"Aedes albopictus is the sole vector for various mosquito-borne viruses, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Ecofriendly biological agents are required to reduce the spread of these mosquito-borne infections. Mosquito densoviruses (MDVs) are entomopathogenic mosquito-specific viruses, which can reduce the capacity of isolated vectors and decrease mosquito-borne viral disease transmission. However, their variable pathogenicity restricts their commercial use. In the present study, we developed a series of novel larvicide oil suspensions (denoted Bacillus thuringiensis (Bti) oil, Ae. albopictus densovirus (AalDV-5) oil, and a mixture of AalDV-5+Bti oil), which were tested against Ae. albopictus larvae under experimental semi-field and open-field conditions. The effect of AalDV-5 on non-target species was also evaluated. The combined effect of AalDV-5+Bti was greater than that of individual toxins and was longer lasting and more persistent compared with the laboratory AalDV-5 virus strain. The virus was quantified on a weekly basis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and was persistently detected in rearing water as well as in dead larvae. Wildtype densovirus is not pathogenic to non-target organisms. The present findings confirm the improved effect of a mixed microbial suspension (AalDV-5+Bti oil) larvicide against Ae. albopictus. The development and testing of these products will enable better control of the vector mosquitoes."
Leveraging National Nursing Home Huddles for Rapid COVID-19 Response,"A disproportionate number of older adult residents of U.S. nursing homes have died during the COVID-19 pandemic. The novelty of the virus spurred frequently changing guidance as nursing facilities navigated response efforts. In May 2020, the 6-month COVID-19 Rapid Response Network for Nursing Homes (RRN) was launched to leverage the concept of huddles across U.S. nursing homes to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity, mortality, and transmission by identifying best practices to rapidly implement, fostering connections between nursing homes, and refocusing the national narrative on optimism for nursing home care response efforts. Daily 20-min huddles transitioned to twice weekly in the program’s final two months. A total of 93 huddles featured 103 speakers with 1960 participants engaging in both live huddles and asynchronous learning. 90.33% of participants said they learned at least two new ideas by participating and 89.17% strongly agreed or agreed that participating improved their ability to lead change in their organization. Qualitative data echoed gratitude for a centralized source of information and best practices and the sense of positivity and community the RRN provided. Leveraging nursing home huddles at the national, regional, local, system, or facility level may serve as a guidepost for future pandemics or work where guidance is new or quickly evolving."
A status report with critical analysis of research trends in exploring medicinal plants as antiviral: Let us dig into the history to predict the future.,"The review article serves as a mini directory of medicinal plants (662 medicinal plants have been identified) that have been investigated for antiviral property between 2015 and 2019. Data have been extracted from Scopus using specific keywords followed by manual sorting to avoid any duplication. Critical analyses of handpicked data have been presented. Mapping of medicinal plants, followed by critical analysis on the families and plant parts investigated in the said tenure, and its correlation with the participating countries and virus types have been critically analyzed. Interceptive role of phytochemicals in impeding viral replication has also been taken note of. Emphasis on India's exploration of various medicinal plants has also been given. Also presents a tutelage, which is likely to revive the interest in natural products for search of potential antivirals. This review is expected to serve as a rich data bank and as a guiding principle for researchers who are planning to explore medicinal plants in search for potential antiviral. It is time that researchers need to revisit their countries' own history of traditional medicine to predict something worthful in future."
Assessment of Neutralizing Antibody Response Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants After 2 to 3 Doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine,"IMPORTANCE: Although 2 and 3 doses of vaccine have been implemented against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the level of immunity achieved by these additional vaccinations remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the induction of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant after 2 and 3 doses of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine among recipients of different ages. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort study was conducted from June 1, 2021, to January 12, 2022, among 82 physicians at Kobe University Hospital who had received 2 doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The rates of positive test results and the titers of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant after 2 and 3 doses of the vaccine were compared with those against other variants and compared among 3 age groups (≤38 years [younger age group], 39-58 years [intermediate age group], and ≥59 years [older age group]). RESULTS: A total of 82 physicians (71 men [87%]; median age, 44 years [IQR, 33-58 years]) participated; 31 (38%) were in the younger age group, 32 (39%) were in the intermediate age group, and 19 (23%) were in the older age group. At 2 months after 2 doses of the vaccine, 23 participants (28%) had neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant, with a titer of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2-1.4), which was 11.8-fold (95% CI, 9.9-13.9) lower than the titer against the D614G variant and the lowest among the variants tested. Although the titer of the neutralizing antibody against the Delta variant tended to be low among the older age group (2.9 [95% CI, 2.0-4.1]), the titers of the neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant were low among all age groups (younger age group, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]; intermediate age group, 1.3 (95% CI, [95% CI, 1.1-1.5]; and older age group, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.4]). At 7 months after 2 doses of the vaccine, 5 participants (6%) had the neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant, but after the booster (third dose) vaccination, all 72 participants who received the booster had the neutralizing antibody, and the titer was 41 (95% CI, 34-49), much higher than that at 7 months after 2 doses of the vaccine (1.0 [95% CI, 1.0-1.1]). This increase in titers was observed regardless of age groups; the titers were 44 (95% CI, 32-59) among the younger age group, 44 (95% CI, 32-59) among the intermediate age group, and 30 (95% CI, 22-41) among the older age group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 82 Japanese participants, 2 doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine did not induce sufficient neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant. However, booster vaccination was associated with induction of a high level of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant, irrespective of the recipient’s age."
Impact of COVID-19 on Liver Transplantation in Hong Kong and Singapore: A Modelling Study,"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) activities during the COVID-19 pandemic have been curtailed in many countries. The impact of various policies restricting LT on outcomes of potential LT candidates is unclear. METHODS: We studied all patients on the nationwide LT waitlists in Hong Kong and Singapore between January 2016 and May 2020. We used continuous time Markov chains to model the effects of different scenarios and varying durations of disruption on LT candidates. FINDINGS: With complete cessation of LT, the projected 1-year overall survival (OS) decreased by 3•6%, 10•51% and 19•21% for a 1-, 3- and 6-month disruption respectively versus no limitation to LT, while 2-year OS decreased by 4•1%, 12•55%, and 23•43% respectively. When only urgent (acute-on-chronic liver failure [ACLF] or acute liver failure) LT was allowed, the projected 1-year OS decreased by a similar proportion: 3•1%, 8•41% and 15•20% respectively. When deceased donor LT (DDLT) and urgent living donor LT (LDLT) were allowed, 1-year projected OS decreased by 1•2%, 5•1% and 8•85% for a 1-, 3- and 6-month disruption respectively. OS was similar when only DDLT was allowed. Complete cessation of LT activities for 3-months resulted in an increased projected incidence of ACLF and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) dropout at 1-year by 49•1% and 107•96% respectively. When only urgent LT was allowed, HCC dropout and ACLF incidence were comparable to the rates seen in the scenario of complete LT cessation. INTERPRETATION: A short and wide-ranging disruption to LT results in better outcomes compared with a longer duration of partial restrictions. FUNDING: None to disclose."
"Histologic evidence of tracheal stenosis directly resulting from SARS-CoV-2 tissue infiltration, a case series","BACKGROUND: There has been an anecdotal increase in the incidence of tracheal stenosis that has coincided with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case series in which we report clinical and pathologic findings of two patients who subsequently developed subglottic tracheal stenosis after having been hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Histopathologic analysis of tissue from these patients shows features consistent with tissue infiltrated with SARS-CoV-2 virus, namely multinucleated syncytial cells with prominent nucleoli. CONCLUSION: Our findings directly implicate SARS-CoV-2 in the pathogenesis of tracheal stenosis."
Cohort profile: the Ontario Life After Workplace Injury Study (OLAWIS),"PURPOSE: The substantial economic burden of work-related injury and illness, borne by workers, employers and social security programmes, is primarily attributed to the durations of work disability among workers whose recovery requires a period of absence from work, with the majority of costs arising from the minority of workers with the longest duration absences. The objective of the Ontario Life After Workplace Injury Study is to describe the long-term health and labour market outcomes of workers disabled by work injury or illness after they are no longer receiving benefits or services from the work disability insurance authority. PARTICIPANTS: Workers disabled by a work-related injury or illness were recruited from a sample frame of disability benefit claimants with oversampling of claimants with longer benefit durations. Characteristics of workers, their employers and claimant benefits were obtained from baseline administrative data. Interviews completed at 18 months post injury (T1) and to be completed at 36 months (T2) measure return-to-work and work status; income; physical and mental health; case manager and healthcare provider interactions and employer accommodations supporting return-to-work and sociodemographic characteristics. Of eligible claimants, 40% (1132) participated in the T1 interview, with 96% consenting to participate in the T2 interview. FINDINGS TO DATE: Preliminary descriptive analyses of T1 data have been completed. The median age was 50 years and 56% were male. At 18 months following injury, 61% were employed by their at-injury employer, 16% had changed employment and 23% were not working. Past-year prescription opioid use was prevalent (34%), as was past-year cannabis use (31%). Longer duration claimants had poorer function, recovery and health and more adverse labour market outcomes. FUTURE PLANS: Multivariate analyses to identify modifiable predictors of adverse health and labour market outcomes and a follow-up survey of 96% of participants consenting to follow-up at 36 months are planned."
A guide to Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas: similarities and differences,"In the extraordinary times the COVID-19 pandemic has created for cancer patients and the health professionals caring for them, the need for strong knowledge and understanding of disease processes and treatments has never been more important. This article presents a review of Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These two common haematology diagnoses are frequently suspected by GPs and non-cancer professionals, and subsequently treated by haematologists and chemotherapy outpatient departments across the country. It is therefore important for all health professionals, including nurses in all settings, to be aware of the main characteristics of both of these lymphomas. There are strong similarities and striking differences between the disease processes, the presenting symptoms, prognostics and treatment pathways. The age of presentation in each is markedly different. There is a significant contrast in the number of subtypes between the two diagnoses, but the presenting symptoms are similar as are investigations required for diagnoses."
No Room for Error: Empiric Treatment for Fulminant Pneumonia,"Early antibiotic administration is critical in cases of sepsis and severe community-acquired pneumonia, which is frequently due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, or influenza. We describe the case of a 29-year-old previously healthy man who presented to an urban emergency department (ED) in the North Central U.S. with fever, hip pain, severe hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. He was intubated and received piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and oseltamivir; given his fulminant presentation and predicted high mortality, doxycycline, methylprednisolone, and amphotericin B were also administered empirically in the ED. A respiratory culture eventually grew Blastomyces dermatitidis, and the patient survived. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to fulminant pneumonitis carries a high mortality. Faced with this scenario and no room for error, it is important that the emergency physician cover for all possible pathogens, including zoonotic bacteria and endemic fungi."
Transient drop in the neutrophil count during COVID-19 regardless of clozapine treatment in patients with mental illness,"Background: Some case series have reported severe neutropenia in patients on clozapine treatment resulting inwithdrawal and raising the concern of clozapine toxicity in the setting of COVID-19. The aims of the study was to compare the neutrophil dynamics between patients with mental illness according to the clozapine treatment. Methods: This observational study included patients with COVID-19 admitted in a psychiatric center from March 2020 to March 2021. Median change of neutrophil count between baseline and the first week of infection was the main outcome. Results: a total of 31 patients were included and 16(51.6%) were on clozapine treatment. Median change of neutrophil count at COVID-19 was -560 cells/ mcL (IQR:-1510,-1160). There was not differences in median neutrophil change according to clozapine treatment: -680(IQR:-1502,-145) cells/mcL vs. -550(IQR:-1805,-405) cells/mcL for the non-clozapine group (p 0.51). After COVID-19 neutrophil counts returned to baseline levels. Neutropenia was observed in 3(9.6%) patients and related to the introduction of medications for the COVID-19 treatment.Median clozapine plasma concentrations increased during COVID-19: 450 (IQR:370-490) ng/mL at baseline vs. 604(400-870) ng/mL at CoVID-19(p 0.04). Five patients had clozapine levels> 600 ng/mL requiring dose reduction. Limitations: the observational design and the small number of patients included. Conclusion: a comprehensive clinical assessment of suspected COVID-19 infection in patients with mental illness, including evaluation for features of pneumonia, full blood count and risk of side effects of newly introduced treatments is essential. In addition, clozapine treatment should be continued, however, consideration should be given to dose reduction."
"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Sources of Information on Vaccines in Spanish Nursing Students: A Cross-Sectional Study","Health professionals are the most influential and main sources of information about vaccines for the general population, as they are regarded as role models by patients and society. The objective of the present study was to determine the knowledge and attitudes of a group of university Nursing students about vaccines, as well as their sources of information and their education needs. A cross-sectional study was performed through a questionnaire (55 items) provided to Nursing students at two Spanish universities. A total of 1122 students participated in the study. The mean score obtained for knowledge about vaccines was 44.6 ± 4.3, and for attitudes towards vaccines, it was 37.2 ± 3.9. Hepatitis B (94.7%) and the Flu (89%) are the two main vaccines they should receive as health workers. The main source of information was the family environment (65.6%). Most of them considered that post-graduate education about vaccines should be provided by academic entities (universities, 62.7%). Among the health professionals, Nurses (85.5%) must be better educated and trained on the subject of vaccines. It is therefore necessary to delve into and complete the nurses’ training on vaccines, to educate them about the risks at the individual level, and their decisive role as promoters of the vaccination strategy for the general population. Universities must become the leaders in vaccine education and training."
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing to Assess Persistent Symptoms at 6 Months in People With COVID-19 Who Survived Hospitalization – A Pilot Study,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to assess physical fitness and its relationship with functional dyspnea in survivors of Covid-19, 6 months after their discharge from the hospital. METHODS: Data collected routinely from people referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following hospitalization for Covid-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Persistent dyspnea was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea (mMRC) scale. RESULTS: Twenty-three people with persistent symptoms were referred for CPET. Mean mMRC dyspnea score was 1 (SD = 1) and was significantly associated with VO2peak (%) (rho = −0.49). At 6 months, those hospitalized in the general ward had a slightly reduced VO2peak (87% [SD = 20]), whereas those who had been in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a moderately reduced VO2peak (77% [SD = 15]). Of note, the results of the CPET revealed that, in all patients, respiratory equivalents were high, power-to-weight ratios were low, and those who had been in the ICU had a relatively low ventilatory efficiency (mean VE/VCO2 slope = 34 [SD = 5]). Analysis of each individual showed that none had a breathing reserve <15% or 11 L/min, all had a normal exercise electrocardiogram, and 4 had a heart rate above 90%. CONCLUSION: At 6 months, persistent dyspnea was associated with reduced physical fitness. This study offers initial insights into the mid-term physical fitness of people who required hospitalization for Covid-19. It also provides novel pathophysiological clues about the underlaying mechanism of the physical limitations associated with persistent dyspnea. Those with persistent dyspnea should be offered a tailored rehabilitation intervention, which should probably include muscle reconditioning, breathing retraining, and perhaps respiratory muscle training. IMPACT: This study is the first to show that a persistent breathing disorder (in addition to muscle deconditioning) can explain persistent symptoms 6 months after hospitalization for Covid-19 infection and suggests that a specific rehabilitation intervention is warranted."
Failing our Most Vulnerable: COVID-19 and Long-Term Care Facilities in Ontario,"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic has taken a fearsome toll on individuals residing in long-term care facilities (LTC). As of April 10, 2020 half COVID-19 deaths in Canada had occurred in LTC. We sought to better understand trends and risk factors for COVID-19 death in LTC in Ontario. Methods: We analyzed a COVID-19 outbreak database created by the Ontario Ministry of Health, for the period March 29-April 7, 2020. Mortality incidence rate ratios for LTC were calculated with community living Ontarians aged > 69 used as the comparator group. Count-based regression methods were used to model temporal trends and identify associations between infection risk in staff and residents, and subsequent LTC resident death. Results: Confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 were identified in 272/627 LTC by April 7, 2020. The incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 death was 13.1 (9.9-17.3) relative to community living adults over 69. Incidence rate ratio increased over time and was 87.28 (90% CrI 9.98 to 557.08) by April 7, 2020. Lagged infection in staff was a strong predictor of death in residents (e.g., adjusted IRR for death per infected staff member 1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.26 at a 6-day lag). Interpretation: Mortality risk in elders in Ontario is currently concentrated in LTC, and this risk has increased sharply over a short period of time. Early identification of risk requires a focus on testing and provision of personal protective equipment to staff, and restructuring the LTC workforce to prevent movement of COVID-19 between LTC."
M402 FACIAL CONTACT DERMATITIS DUE TO MASKS IN THE COVID-19 ERA,
US racial inequality may be as deadly as COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a catastrophic increase in US mortality. How does the scale of this pandemic compare to another US catastrophe: racial inequality? Using demographic models, I estimate how many excess White deaths would raise US White mortality to the best-ever (lowest) US Black level under alternative, plausible assumptions about the age patterning of excess mortality in 2020. I find that 400,000 excess White deaths would be needed to equal the best mortality ever recorded among Blacks. For White mortality in 2020 to reach levels that Blacks experience outside of pandemics, current COVID-19 mortality levels would need to increase by a factor of nearly 6. Moreover, White life expectancy in 2020 will remain higher than Black life expectancy has ever been unless nearly 700,000 excess White deaths occur. Even amid COVID-19, US White mortality is likely to be less than what US Blacks have experienced every year. I argue that, if Black disadvantage operates every year on the scale of Whites’ experience of COVID-19, then so too should the tools we deploy to fight it. Our imagination should not be limited by how accustomed the United States is to profound racial inequality."
The Effect of Self-Discrepancy on Online Behavior: A Literature Review,"People will experience self-discrepancy when they perceive their actual self is distanced from their ideal self and ought self. The perceived self-discrepancy has a significant impact on people’s online behavior. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the research on self-discrepancy in the Internet era through a literature review. A total of 37 papers were included in this review. First, this study presents the basic characteristic of the reviewed articles (such as research contexts, samples, and data collection methods). Second, it summarized how the Internet affected people’s self-discrepancy. Third, this review identified how self-discrepancy was associated with different kinds of online behavior (such as impression management, knowledge contribution, and gaming addiction). Finally, this study outlined several possible directions for future research."
Human rights and COVID-19 triage: a comment on the Bath protocol,"In their discussion paper of November 2020, Cook et al present a draft protocol for navigating circumstances in which emergency services are overwhelmed. Their paper suggests that COVID-related triage decisions should be based on clinical assessment, patient and family consultation, and a range of ethical considerations. In this response, we note that the protocol exhibits an ambiguity that is likely to result in irresolvable dilemmas when put into practice. This ambiguity is exemplified in the paper’s prime ethical imperative (to ‘save more lives and more years of life’), which takes the form of an undefined conjunction whose practical implications are left unspecified. We see this ambiguity in the prime imperative as one manifestation of a broader set of tensions in the protocol. We show that the discipline of human rights provides an essential supplement to the ethical framework on which Cook and colleagues rely, providing a framework for understanding and working through triage dilemmas involving age, discrimination and equality."
Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Biological Activity of 8-Hydroxyquinolines,"Compounds containing the 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) 1 nucleus exhibit a wide range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, anticancer, and antifungal effects. The chemistry and biology of this group have attracted the attention of chemists, medicinal chemists, and professionals in health sciences. A number of prescribed drugs incorporate this group, and numerous 8-HQ- based molecules can be used to develop potent lead compounds with good efficacy and low toxicity. This review focusses on the recent advances in the synthesis of 8-HQ derivatives with different pharmacological properties, including anticancer, antiviral, and antibacterial activities. For this purpose, recent relevant references were searched in different known databases and search engines, such as MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, Cochrane, Scientific Information Database (SID), SciFinder, and Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge. This review article provides a literature overview of the various synthetic strategies and biological activities of 8-HQ derivatives and covers the recent related literature. Taken together, compounds containing the 8-HQ moiety have huge therapeutic value and can act as potential building blocks for various pharmacologically active scaffolds. In addition, several described compounds in this review could act leads for the development of drugs against numerous diseases including cancer."
"Sexual Behaviors, Substance Use, and Quality of Life Among Individuals Using PrEP in San Francisco During the COVID-19 Pandemic Shelter-In-Place Orders: A Cross-Sectional Survey",
Rapid and Accurate Campylobacter jejuni Detection With CRISPR-Cas12b Based on Newly Identified Campylobacter jejuni-Specific and -Conserved Genomic Signatures,"Campylobacter jejuni is among the most prevalent foodborne zoonotic pathogens leading to diarrheal diseases. In this study, we developed a CRISPR-Cas12b-based system to rapidly and accurately detect C. jejuni contamination. Identification of C. jejuni-specific and -conserved genomic signatures is a fundamental step in development of the detection system. By comparing C. jejuni genome sequences with those of the closely related Campylobacter coli, followed by comprehensive online BLAST searches, a 20-bp C. jejuni-conserved (identical in 1024 out of 1037 analyzed C. jejuni genome sequences) and -specific (no identical sequence detected in non-C. jejuni strains) sequence was identified and the system was then assembled. In further experiments, strong green fluorescence was observed only when C. jejuni DNA was present in the system, highlighting the specificity of this system. The assay, with a sample-to-answer time of ∼40 min, positively detected chicken samples that were contaminated with a dose of approximately 10 CFU C. jejuni per gram of chicken, which was >10 times more sensitive than the traditional Campylobacter isolation method, suggesting that this method shows promise for onsite C. jejuni detection. This study provides an example of bioinformatics-guided CRISPR-Cas12b-based detection system development for rapid and accurate onsite pathogen detection."
"‘Intelligent’ lockdown, intelligent effects? Results from a survey on gender (in)equality in paid work, the division of childcare and household work, and quality of life among parents in the Netherlands during the Covid-19 lockdown","OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures have substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given the existence of persistent gender inequality prior to the pandemic, particularly among parents, it is crucial to study the societal impact of COVID-19 from a gender perspective. The objective of this paper is to use representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020 to explore differences between mothers and fathers in three areas: paid work, the division of childcare and household tasks, and three dimensions of quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Additionally, we explore whether changes take place in these dimensions by comparing the situation prior to the lockdown with the situation during the lockdown. METHOD: We use descriptive methods (crosstabulations) supported by multivariate modelling (linear regression modelling for continuous outcomes; linear probability modelling (LPM) for binary outcomes (0/1 outcomes); and multinomial logits for multinomial outcomes) in a cross-sectional survey design. RESULTS: Results show that the way in which parents were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. Mothers work in essential occupations more often than fathers, report more adjustments of the times at which they work, and experience both more and less work pressure in comparison to before the lockdown. Moreover, mothers continue to do more childcare and household work than fathers, but some fathers report taking on greater shares of childcare and housework during the lockdown in comparison to before. Mothers also report a larger decline in leisure time than fathers. We find no gender differences in the propensity to work from home, in perceived work-life balance, or in relationship dynamics. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we find that gender inequality in paid work, the division of childcare and household work, and the quality of life are evident during the first lockdown period. Specifically, we find evidence of an increase in gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life when comparing the situation prior to and during the lockdown, as well as a decrease in gender inequality in the division of childcare and household work. We conclude that the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnifies some gender inequalities while lessening others. DISCUSSION: The insights we provide offer key comparative evidence based on a representative, probability-based sample for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the limitations in this study is the cross-sectional design. Further study, in the form of a longitudinal design, will be crucial in investigating the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender inequality."
Salivary SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid detection: a prospective cohort study,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 quick testing and reporting are now considered relevant for the containment of new pandemic waves. Antigen testing in self-collected saliva might be useful. We compared the diagnostic performance of salivary and naso-pharyngeal swab (NPS) SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by a rapid chemiluminescent assay (CLEIA) and two different point-of-care (POC) immunochromatographic assays, with that of molecular testing. Methods. 234 patients were prospectively enrolled. Paired self-collected saliva (Salivette) and NPS were obtained to perform rRT-PCR, chemiluminescent (Lumipulse G) and POC (NPS: Fujirebio and Abbott; saliva: Fujirebio) for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Results. The overall agreement between NPS and saliva rRT-PCR was 78.7%, reaching 91.7% at the first week from symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 CLEIA antigen was highly accurate in distinguishing between positive and negative NPS (ROC-AUC=0.939, 95%CI:0.903-0.977), with 81.6% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity. This assay on saliva had an overall good accuracy (ROC- AUC=0.805, 95%CI:0.740-0.870), reaching the optimal value within 7 days from symptom onset (Sensitivity: 72%; Specificity: 97%). POC antigen in saliva had a very limited sensitivity (13%), performing better in NPS (Sensitivity: 48% and 66%; Specificity: 100% and 99% for Espline and Abbott respectively), depending on viral loads. Conclusions: Self-collected saliva is a valid alternative to NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection not only by molecular, but also by CLEIA antigen testing, for which the highest diagnostic accuracy was achieved in the first week from symptom onset. Saliva is not suitable for POC, although the accuracy of these tests appears satisfactory for NPS with high viral load."
"Configurations for obtaining in-consultation assistance from supervisors in general practice training, and patient-related barriers to trainee help-seeking: a survey study","BACKGROUND: General practice (GP) trainees may seek supervisor assistance to complete their patient consultations. This in-consultation assistance plays a key role in the supervisory oversight of trainees and in trainee learning. It may be obtained face-to-face, or using phone or messaging systems, and either in front of patients or outside their hearing. Trainee concerns about decreased patient impressions of their competence, and discomfort presenting patients within their hearing, act as barriers to seeking help during consultations. Little is known about the frequency and associations of trainee concerns about these patient-related barriers, or the various trainee-supervisor-patient configurations used to obtain in-consultation assistance. METHODS: Australian GP trainees rated their frequency of use of five specific configurations for obtaining in-consultation assistance, perceived change in patient impressions of their competence after this assistance, and relative trainee comfort presenting patients outside, compared to within, patients’ hearing. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Responses were received from 778 Australian GP trainees (response rate 89%). Help-seeking configurations did not differ between trainees at different training stages, except for greater use of electronic messaging in later stages. In-consultation assistance was most commonly provided by phone between trainee and supervisor consulting rooms, or outside the trainee’s patient’s hearing. Supervisor assistance in the trainee’s room face-to-face with the patient was reported as either never or rarely obtained by 12% of respondents. More trainees (25%) perceived that patient impressions of their competence increased after help-seeking than perceived that these impressions decreased (19%). Most trainees (55%) preferred to present patients outside their hearing. Trainee age was the only variable associated with both patient-related barriers. CONCLUSION: Supervisors appear to have considerable influence over trainee help-seeking, including which configurations are used and trainee perceptions of patient-related barriers. In-consultation supervision may actually increase trainee perceptions of patient impressions of their competence. Many supervisors and trainees may benefit from additional educational and workplace interventions to facilitate comfortable and effective trainee help-seeking in front of patients. More work is required to understand the clinical and educational implications of different help-seeking configurations when trainees require ‘just in time’ supervisor assistance."

Artificial intelligence in perioperative management of major gastrointestinal surgeries,"Artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrated by machines is based on reinforcement learning and revolves around the usage of algorithms. The purpose of this review was to summarize concepts, the scope, applications, and limitations in major gastrointestinal surgery. This is a narrative review of the available literature on the key capabilities of AI to help anesthesiologists, surgeons, and other physicians to understand and critically evaluate ongoing and new AI applications in perioperative management. AI uses available databases called “big data” to formulate an algorithm. Analysis of other data based on these algorithms can help in early diagnosis, accurate risk assessment, intraoperative management, automated drug delivery, predicting anesthesia and surgical complications and postoperative outcomes and can thus lead to effective perioperative management as well as to reduce the cost of treatment. Perioperative physicians, anesthesiologists, and surgeons are well-positioned to help integrate AI into modern surgical practice. We all need to partner and collaborate with data scientists to collect and analyze data across all phases of perioperative care to provide clinical scenarios and context. Careful implementation and use of AI along with real-time human interpretation will revolutionize perioperative care, and is the way forward in future perioperative management of major surgery."
A water-soluble membrane for SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid sampling and detection,"This communication describes a novel water-soluble membrane prepared from chitosan intended for SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid collection and detection. The CSH membrane formed from nanofibers shows promising potential in the quantitative determination of the SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acids at a concentration of 102 copies per L in air. The sponge-like structure which allows gas to pass through for collection of viral nucleic acids potentially provides simple, fast, and reliable sampling as well as detection of various types of airborne viruses."

Fleeting Beauty—The World of Plant Fragrances and Their Application,"This article is devoted to some aspects of the fragrant substances of plant origin applied in the food industry and perfumery as well. Since antiquity many extractive techniques have been developed to obtain essential oils. Some of them are still applied, but new ones, like microwave or ultrasound-assisted extractions, are more and more popular and they save time and cost. Independently of the procedure, the resulting essential oils are the source of many so-called isolates. These can be applied as food additives, medicines, or can be used as starting materials for organic synthesis. Some substances exist in very small amounts in plant material so the extraction is not economically profitable but, after their chemical structures were established and synthetic procedures were developed, in some cases they are prepared on an industrial scale. The substances described below are only a small fraction of the 2000–3000 fragrant molecules used to make our life more enjoyable, either in food or perfumes. Additionally, a few examples of allelopathic fragrant compounds, present in their natural state, will be denoted and some of their biocidal features will be mentioned as an arising “green” knowledge in agriculture."
"Improving mental health literacy among young people aged 11–15 years in Java, Indonesia: the co-development of a culturally-appropriate, user-centred resource (The IMPeTUs Intervention)","BACKGROUND: Many mental health problems emerge in late childhood and contribute significantly to the global burden of disease. Adverse outcomes can extend into adulthood if left untreated. This impact is exacerbated in low- and middle-income countries where significant treatment gaps persist. Improving mental health literacy may offer an effective strategy for early intervention but remains underexplored in these contexts. METHODS: An intervention was co-developed with children and young people (CYP) by undertaking a needs analysis combined with stakeholder consensus activities. A systematic review of mental health literacy interventions in South-East Asia was undertaken in addition to semi-structured interviews with 43 children and young people (19 with and 24 without experience of anxiety and depression), 19 parents of children with experience of mental health problems and 25 education and health professionals. A focus group was also held with 8 key stakeholders immersed nationally in policy and practice. Interview schedules explored participants’ experiences of mental health, unmet needs and priorities for intervention. Data were synthesised and presented at a 3-day co-production workshop. Attendees included 13 CYP, 6 parents/guardians, 2 teachers, 8 health professionals, 2 academics and 3 game designers. Consensus exercises were utilised to identify the preferred format, content and delivery of the intervention. A smaller group of patient and public involvement contributors worked with designers to further iterate the intervention. RESULTS: An immersive storyline digital application was co-developed for young people aged 11–15 with the primary aim of improving mental health literacy and self-management. The intervention comprises two chapters; one depression focussed, and the other anxiety focussed. The storyline format is interspersed with interactive games and exercises to promote engagement and encourage self-management. CYP also take part in group sessions delivered by trained facilitators before and after intervention use to discuss outcomes of and issues raised during the game. CONCLUSION: The IMPeTUs intervention has been co-designed for CYP aged 11–15 to improve mental health literacy and enhance self-management abilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Indonesian digital intervention to improve mental health literacy and self-management for this population. Implementation, acceptability, and impact are currently being explored in a multi-site case study evaluation.

Kratom Use Within the Context of the Evolving Opioid Crisis and the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States,"Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa, Korth.) is an evergreen tree that is indigenous to Southeast Asia. When ingested, kratom leaves or decoctions from the leaves have been reported to produce complex stimulant and opioid-like effects. For generations, native populations in Southeast Asia have used kratom products to stave off fatigue, improve mood, alleviate pain and manage symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Despite the long history of kratom use in Asia, it is only within the past 10–20 years that kratom has emerged as an important herbal agent in the United States, where it is being used for the self-treatment of pain, opioid withdrawal symptoms, and mood disorders. The increase in the use of kratom in the United States has coincided with the serious epidemic of opioid abuse and dependence. Since 2015, efforts to restrict access to prescription opioids have resulted in a marked increase in the use of “street” opioids such as heroin and illicit fentanyl. At the same time, many patients with chronic pain conditions or opioid use disorder have been denied access to appropriate medical help. The lack of access to care for patients with chronic pain and opioid use disorder has been magnified by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this report, we highlight how these converging factors have led to a surge in interest in kratom as a potential harm reduction agent in the treatment of pain and opioid use disorder."
"Viral Etiology of Acute Respiratory Infection in Gansu Province, China, 2011","BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the leading cause of children and their leading killer. ARIs are responsible for at least six percent of the world's disability and death. Viruses are one of the most common agents causing ARIs. Few studies on the viral etiology and clinical characteristics of ARIs have been performed in the northwest region of China, including Gansu Province. METHODS: Clinical and demographic information and throat swabs were collected from 279 patients from January 1st to December 30st, 2011. Multiplex RT-PCR was performed to detect 16 respiratory viral pathogens. RESULTS: 279 patients were admitted for ARIs. The patients aged from 1 month to 12 years, with the median age of 2 years. Of which, 105 (37.6%) were positive for at least one pathogen. A total of 136 respiratory viral pathogens were identified from the 105 patients. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected pathogen (26.5%, 36/136), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1–3 (22.1%, 30/136), human rhinovirus (HRV) (21.3%, 29/136), human coronavirus (CoV) (10.3%, 14/136) and human adenovirus (HAdV) (9.6%, 13/136). Influenza A (Flu A), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (BoCA) were found 4.4%, 3.7% and 2.2%, respectively. Influenza B (Flu B) and seasonal influenza A H1N1(sH1N1) were not detected. Single-infections were detected in 30.5% (85/279) of cases. RSV was the most common pathogens in patients under 1 year and showed seasonal variation with peaks during winter and spring. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents data on the epidemiology of viral pathogens associated with ARIs among children in Gansu Province, China. RSV is most frequently detected in our study. The findings could serve as a reference for local CDC in drawing up further plans to prevent and control ARIs."

Air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the Yangtze River Delta Region: An insight into the impact of human activity pattern changes on air pollution variation,"Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19 has spreaded rapidly across the world. To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, leading to lowered SO2, NO x , PM2.5 and VOCs emissions by approximately 16–26%, 29–47%, 27–46% and 37–57% during the Level I and Level II response periods respectively. These emission reduction has played a significant role in the improvement of air quality. Concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 decreased by 31.8%, 45.1% and 20.4% during the Level I period; and 33.2%, 27.2% and 7.6% during the Level II period compared with 2019. However, ozone did not show any reduction and increased greatly. Our results also show that even during the lockdown, with primary emissions reduction of 15%–61%, the daily average PM2.5 concentrations range between 15 and 79 μg m−3, which shows that background and residual pollutions are still high. Source apportionment results indicate that the residual pollution of PM2.5 comes from industry (32.2–61.1%), mobile (3.9–8.1%), dust (2.6–7.7%), residential sources (2.1–28.5%) in YRD and 14.0–28.6% contribution from long-range transport coming from northern China. This indicates that in spite of the extreme reductions in primary emissions, it cannot fully tackle the current air pollution. Re-organisation of the energy and industrial strategy together with trans-regional joint-control for a full long-term air pollution plan need to be further taken into account."
Toward Nanotechnology-Enabled Approaches against the COVID-19 Pandemic,"[Image: see text] The COVID-19 outbreak has fueled a global demand for effective diagnosis and treatment as well as mitigation of the spread of infection, all through large-scale approaches such as specific alternative antiviral methods and classical disinfection protocols. Based on an abundance of engineered materials identifiable by their useful physicochemical properties through versatile chemical functionalization, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches to cope with this emergency. Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and computational science, we outline how nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored. In this case, nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the pulmonary system to inhibit interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and viral S protein. Moreover, the concept of “nanoimmunity by design” can help us to design materials for immune modulation, either stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in the context of vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 or in counteracting the cytokine storm, respectively. In addition to disease prevention and therapeutic potential, nanotechnology has important roles in diagnostics, with potential to support the development of simple, fast, and cost-effective nanotechnology-based assays to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers. In summary, nanotechnology is critical in counteracting COVID-19 and will be vital when preparing for future pandemics."
"Quercetin, Inflammation and Immunity","In vitro and some animal models have shown that quercetin, a polyphenol derived from plants, has a wide range of biological actions including anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities; as well as attenuating lipid peroxidation, platelet aggregation and capillary permeability. This review focuses on the physicochemical properties, dietary sources, absorption, bioavailability and metabolism of quercetin, especially main effects of quercetin on inflammation and immune function. According to the results obtained both in vitro and in vivo, good perspectives have been opened for quercetin. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to better characterize the mechanisms of action underlying the beneficial effects of quercetin on inflammation and immunity."
An LC-MRM assay for the quantification of metanephrines from dried blood spots for the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas,"The quantitation of metanephrine (MN), normetanephrine (NMN), and 3-methoxytyramine (3MT) – referred to as metanephrines -- by LC-MS/MS is the gold-standard for screening for pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas (PPGLs), tumors of the adrenal gland and the peripheral nervous system. An assay for metanephrines from dried blood spots (DBSs) would be of high clinical utility as it simplifies sample collection, enables remote sampling, and could increase compliance with the clinical recommendation for supine sampling. Moreover, DBS sampling facilitates the measurement of blood-derived metanephrines in pediatric patients – where DBSs are well-established – in order to diagnose neuroblastomas. Here, we adapted an established derivatization-based LC-MRM-MS assay for plasma catecholamines, and optimized the sample extraction, LC, and MS parameters to produce a fast, sensitive, and robust method for the measurement of metanephrines from DBSs, including 3-methoxytyramine. The DBS samples were excised, derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) on-spot, extracted, and measured by LC-MRM-MS. To validate assay suitability and performance, we assessed the linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery, and matrix effects of the method, and determined the stability of metanephrines in DBSs under different storage conditions. Assay performance for NMN, MN, and 3MT was sufficient for quantitation from a single DBS within a linear range from 40 – 2000 pg/mL MN and NMN were stable in DBSs for 2 weeks, whereas 3MT was stable for one week regardless of storage temperature. Altogether, this work represents the first quantitative LC-MS/MS method for metanephrines from DBSs and provides a novel opportunity for the diagnosis of PPGLs and neuroblastomas in the future."
Bronchial Mucosal Microcirculation in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Role in Innate Humoral Defense?,
Upper-room ultraviolet air disinfection might help to reduce COVID-19 transmission in buildings,"As the world economies get out of the lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to assess the suitability of known technologies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in confined spaces such as buildings. This feasibility study looks at the method of upper-room ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection that has already proven its efficacy in preventing the transmission of airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis. Using published data from various sources it is shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is highly likely to be susceptible to UV damage while suspended in air irradiated by UV-C at levels that are acceptable and safe for upper-room applications. This is while humans are present in the room. Both the expected and worst-case scenarios are investigated to show the efficacy of the upper-room UV-C approach to reduce COVID-19 air transmission in a confined space with moderate but sufficient height. Discussion is given on the methods of analysis and the differences between virus susceptibility to UV-C when aerosolised or in liquid or on a surface."
Dual use of e-cigarettes with conventional tobacco is associated with increased sleep latency in cross-sectional Study,"The health effects of e-cigarettes remain relatively unknown, including their impact on sleep quality. We previously showed in a pilot study that females who smoke both conventional tobacco and vape e-cigarettes (dual users) had decreased sleep quality (measurement of how well an individual is sleeping) and increased sleep latency (amount of time to fall asleep), suggesting an influence by gender. Cough is also known to adversely impact sleep quality and may be caused by inhalant use. As a result, we undertook this study to assess the impact of e-cigarette, conventional tobacco, and dual use on sleep quality, sleep latency, cough, and drug use. Participants (n = 1198) were recruited through online surveys posted to social media sites with a monetary incentive. Participants were grouped by inhalant use, with 8% e-cigarette users, 12% conventional tobacco users, 30% dual users, and 51% non-smokers/non-vapers. Dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional tobacco was associated with increased sleep latency relative to non-smokers/non-vapers by multivariable linear regression (mean difference of 4.08; 95% CI: 1.12 to 7.05, raw p = 0.007, adjusted p = 0.042); however, dual usage was not significantly associated with sleep quality relative to non-smokers/non-vapers (mean difference 0.22, 95%CI: (−0.36, 0.80), raw p = 0.452, adjust p = 0.542). Dual use was also associated with a higher reporting of cough (p = 0.038), as well as increased marijuana (p < 0.001) and cocaine (p < 0.001) usage. This study demonstrates that dual use is associated with longer sleep latency, and suggests that the shared component of nicotine may be a driver. Because sleep broadly impacts multiple aspects of human health, defining the associations of e-cigarettes and vaping devices on sleep is critical to furthering our understanding of their influence on the body."
The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 reprograms both adaptive and innate immune responses,"The mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech was the first registered COVID-19 vaccine and has been shown to be up to 95% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Little is known about the broad effects of the new class of mRNA vaccines, especially whether they have combined effects on innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we confirmed that BNT162b2 vaccination of healthy individuals induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants. Interestingly, however, the BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon stimulation with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral, fungal and bacterial) stimuli. The response of innate immune cells to TLR4 and TLR7/8 ligands was lower after BNT162b2 vaccination, while fungi-induced cytokine responses were stronger. In conclusion, the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine induces complex functional reprogramming of innate immune responses, which should be considered in the development and use of this new class of vaccines."
Reappraisal of gap analysis for effusive crises at Piton de la Fournaise,"Effective and rapid effusive crisis response is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with lava flows that could threaten or inundate inhabited or visited areas. At Piton de la Fournaise (La Réunion, France), well-established protocols between Observatoire Volcanologique du Piton de la Fournaise – Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (OVPF-IPGP) and civil protection, and between scientists of a multinational array of institutes, allow effective tracking of eruptive crises and hazard management embracing all stakeholders. To assess the outstanding needs for such responses Tsang and Lindsay (J Appl Volcanol 9:9, 2020) applied a gap analysis to assess research gaps in terms of preparedness, response and recovery at 11 effusive centers, including Piton de la Fournaise. For Piton de la Fournaise, their gap analysis implied widespread gaps in the state of knowledge. However, their work relied on incomplete and erroneous data and methods, resulting in a gap analysis that significantly underrepresented this state of knowledge. We thus here re-build a correct database for Piton de la Fournaise, properly define the scope of an appropriate gap analysis, and provide a robust gap analysis, finding that there are, actually, very few gaps for Piton de la Fournaise. This is a result of the existence of a great quantity of published work in the peer-reviewed literature, as well as frequent reports documenting event impact in the local press and observatory reports. At Piton de la Fournaise, this latter (observatory-based) resource is largely due to the efforts of OVPF-IPGP who have a wealth of experience having responded to 81 eruptions since its creation in 1979 through the end of September 2021. Although welcome and necessary, especially if it is made by a group of scientists outside the local management of the volcanic risk (i.e., a neutral group), such gap analysis need to be sure to fully consider all available peer-reviewed literature, as well as newspaper reports, observatory releases and non-peer-reviewed eruption reports, so as to be complete and correct. Fundamentally, such an analysis needs to consider the information collected and produced by the volcano observatory charged with handling surveillance operations and reporting duties to civil protection for the volcano under analysis. As a very minimum, to ensure that a necessarily comprehensive and complete treatment of the scientific literature has been completed, we recommend that a third party expert, who is a recognized specialist in terms of research at the site considered, reviews and checks the material used for the gap analysis before final release of recommendations.

Allergic contact dermatitis caused by elastic bands of an N95 mask,
Incidence and seasonality of respiratory viruses causing acute respiratory infections in the Northern United Arab Emirates,"BACKGROUND: The data on the seasonality of respiratory viruses helps to ensure the optimal vaccination period and to monitor the possible outbreaks of variant type. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to describe the molecular epidemiology and seasonality of acute respiratory infection (ARI)‐related respiratory viruses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). METHODS: Both upper and lower respiratory specimens were collected for the analysis from all the patients who visited the Sheikh Khalifa Specialty Hospital (SKSH) with ARI for over 2 years. The multiplex real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT‐PCR) test was used to detect respiratory viruses, which include human adenovirus, influenza virus (FLU) A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus, human enterovirus, human coronavirus, and human bocavirus. RESULTS: A total of 1,362 respiratory samples were collected from 733 (53.8%) male and 629 (46.2%) female patients with ARI who visited the SKSH between November 2015 and February 2018. The rRT‐PCR test revealed an overall positivity rate of 37.2% (507/1362). The positive rate increased during winter; it was highest in December and lowest in September. FLU was the most frequently detected virus (273/1362 [20.0%]), followed by human rhinovirus (146/1362 [10.7%]). The FLU positivity rate showed two peaks, which occurred in August and December. The peak‐to‐low ratio for FLU was 2.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.52‐3.35). CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of FLU in the UAE parallels to that of temperate countries. The trend of the small peak of FLU in the summer suggests a possibility of semi‐seasonal pattern in the UAE."
The Escalating Effects of Wildlife Tourism on Human–Wildlife Conflict,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Communities adjacent to protected areas usually face conflict with protected wildlife. Wildlife tourism is regarded as a tool to mitigate such conflict through bringing economic benefits to villagers and then increasing villagers’ tolerance of wildlife. We used qualitative methods to conduct a case study on a macaque tourism attraction in China and find that tourism may escalate rather than mitigate community–wildlife conflict. Provisioning food is a common way to attract wild animals to visit and stay in human activity areas. In the case of macaque tourism, anthropogenic food provision caused rapid population increase and more intra-group aggressive behaviors. More tourist–macaque interactions resulted in macaques becoming habituated to human’s presence. These ecological impacts on macaques led more invasion to the surrounding community and intensified resident–macaque conflict. Meanwhile, low community participation in tourism generated few benefits for residents and did not help alter residents’ hostile attitudes towards the macaques. Local residents gradually retreated from agriculture as the macaques became more intrusive. We propose a holistic model combining social and ecological perspectives to evaluate the role of wildlife tourism in resolving community–wildlife conflict. We suggest that wildlife tourism should minimize human–wildlife intimate interactions and food provision. ABSTRACT: Human–wildlife conflict is a barrier to achieving sustainable biodiversity conservation and community development in protected areas. Tourism is often regarded as a tool to mitigate such conflict. However, existing studies have mainly adopted a socio-economic perspective to examine the benefits of tourism for communities, neglecting the ecological effects of tourism. This case study of macaque tourism on a peninsula in China illustrates that tourism can escalate rather than mitigate human–wildlife conflict. Fifty-three stakeholders were interviewed and secondary data were collected to understand the development of rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) tourism and community–macaque conflict. The results show that food provision and tourist–macaque interactions rapidly increased the macaques’ population, habituation, and aggressive behaviors, which led them to invade the surrounding community more often and exacerbated human–macaque conflict. Meanwhile, low community participation in tourism generated few benefits for residents and did not help alter residents’ hostile attitudes towards the macaques. Local residents gradually retreated from agriculture as the macaques became more intrusive. A holistic approach to evaluating the role of wildlife tourism in resolving community–wildlife conflict is proposed and practical suggestions for alleviating such conflict are given."
Genetic and non-genetic risk factors associated with atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmic disorder and its prevalence in the United States is projected to increase to more than twelve million cases in 2030. AF increases the risk of other forms of cardiovascular disease, including stroke. As the incidence of atrial fibrillation increases dramatically with age, it is paramount to elucidate risk factors underlying AF pathogenesis. Here, we review tissue and cellular pathways underlying AF, as well as critical components that impact AF susceptibility including genetic and environmental risk factors. Finally, we provide the latest information on potential links between SARS-CoV-2 and human AF. Improved understanding of mechanistic pathways holds promise in preventative care and early diagnostics, and also introduces novel targeted forms of therapy that might attenuate AF progression and maintenance."
Association between consumption of fermented vegetables and COVID-19 mortality at a country level in Europe,"Background Many foods have an antioxidant activity and nutrition may mitigate COVID-19. Some of the countries with a low COVID-19 mortality are those with a relatively high consumption of traditional fermented foods. To test the potential role of fermented foods in COVID-19 mortality in Europe, we performed an ecological study. Methods The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to study the country consumption of fermented vegetables, pickled/marinated vegetables, fermented milk, yoghurt and fermented sour milk. We obtained the COVID-19 mortality per number of inhabitants from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. EuroStat data were used for data on potential confounders at the country level including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (2019), population density (2018), percentage of people older than 64 years (2019), unemployment rate (2019) and percentage obesity (2014, to avoid missing values). Mortality counts were analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression models - with log of population as an offset - to model the death rate while accounting for over-dispersion. Results Of all the variables considered, including confounders, only fermented vegetables reached statistical significance with the COVID-19 death rate per country. For each g/day increase in the average national consumption of fermented vegetables, the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreased by 35.4% (95% CI: 11.4%, 35.5%). Adjustment did not change the point estimate and results were still significant. Discussion The negative ecological association between COVID-19 mortality and consumption of fermented vegetables supports the a priory hypothesis previously reported. The hypothesis needs to be tested in individual studies performed in countries where the consumption of fermented vegetables is common."
Long-Term Social Human-Robot Interaction for Neurorehabilitation: Robots as a Tool to Support Gait Therapy in the Pandemic,"COVID-19 pandemic has affected the population worldwide, evidencing new challenges and opportunities for several kinds of emergent and existing technologies. Social Assistive Robotics could be a potential tool to support clinical care areas, promoting physical distancing, and reducing the contagion rate. In this context, this paper presents a long-term evaluation of a social robotic platform for gait neurorehabilitation. The robot's primary roles are monitoring physiological progress and promoting social interaction with human distancing during the sessions. A clinical validation with ten patients during 15 sessions were conducted in a rehabilitation center located in Colombia. Results showed that the robot's support improves the patients' physiological progress by reducing their unhealthy spinal posture time, with positive acceptance. 65% of patients described the platform as helpful and secure. Regarding the robot's role within the therapy, the health care staff agreed (>95%) that this tool can promote physical distancing and it is highly useful to support neurorehabilitation throughout the pandemic. These outcomes suggest the benefits of this tool to be further implemented in the pandemic."
Fernando de Noronha: how an island controlled the community transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil,"Introduction: Fernando Noronha (FNA) is a small Brazilian archipelago in the Atlantic, part of the state of Pernambuco that COVID-19 has decimated. Anticipating the worst from the pandemic, Island and state authorities implemented a series of public health actions to contain the epidemic. This paper, reporting the results of the first wave of a cohort study, documents the measures and their effects through a cohort study. Methods: Measures were documented at the time of implementation. A random sample of 904 residents were selected from the health register, interviewed and tested for COVID-19 (RT-PCR and serology). The survey explored socioeconomic variables and adherence to prevention behaviors. Results: Flights were reduced from 38 to once a week, FNA was closed to tourism, schools were closed, and testing and tracing contacts was mandated along with social distancing and use of masks. A household lockdown was briefly imposed for residents. A prevalence of 5.1% was found, and a total of 158 cases of COVID-19 was estimated, although only 28 had been reported in routine surveillance. Half of the population reported food insecurity and applied for government COVID-19 benefits. Adherence to control measures was high, except for intrahousehold mask use with family and friends. Conclusion: Despite high levels of COVID-19 in Pernambuco, continued exposure through the provision of essential services from the mainland, and lack of direction from national authorities, FNA was able to implement a series of prevention measures unique in Brazil that contained the epidemic on the island."

Cytomegalovirus meningoencephalitis in a case of severe COVID-19 Pneumonia. A case report,"The use of steroids and other immune modulatory therapies in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia predisposes patients to the reemergence of opportunistic infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation can be one of them. A 55-year-old gentleman with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure who was ventilated and received steroids but no other immunomodulatory drugs; had altered sensorium and multiple episodes of seizures in the later course of his illness. Brain MRI showed leptomeningeal enhancement and encephalopathy changes, electroencephalography (EEG) was suggestive of diffuse encephalopathy and his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed high Cytomegalovirus PCR DNA titers (103,614). The patient made a complete recovery after treatment with Ganciclovir. Altered sensorium in cases of COVID-19 can be multifactorial. High index of suspicion for reactivation of dormant infections is warranted. CMV meningoencephalitis is one of the differential diagnoses. We believe this is the first case reported of CMV meningoencephalitis in the setting of severe COVID-19 infection."
Thought Problems and Aggression Over Time Among Youth in Foster Care,"BACKGROUND: Youth in foster care may demonstrate high levels of aggression and thought problems. There is a growing trend to consider mental health symptoms of youth involved with the foster care system from a developmental trauma perspective. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test if trauma, race, age, and gender predicted variability in thought problems and aggression for youth in foster care. METHOD: The sample (n = 303) included youth in out-of-home placements with a mean age of 14 years, a diverse racial demographic, and almost an equal percentage of males and females. Participants were assessed over three waves using a series of multilevel growth curve models. RESULTS: Results indicated significant decreases in thought problems and aggression and youth with higher levels of trauma reported higher initial levels and swifter decreases of both thought problems and aggression over time. CONCLUSIONS: While trauma was associated with aggression and thought problems, results found that youth demonstrated significant decreases in aggression and thought problems over time. A better understanding of the long-term effects of trauma on thought problems and aggression of youth in foster care is needed. While our findings suggest foster care may be protective in fostering resilience, additional research on the nature of potential positive effects of foster care on aggression and thought problems is suggested."

"Impact of COVID-19 on Transgender Women and Hijra: Insights from Gujarat, India","Protecting vulnerable populations from the COVID-19 pandemic is a strategic imperative, especially when considering the potential vulnerability it has on a wide range of marginalized communities. Transgender women and hijra individuals who struggle to cope financially, mentally, or physically are vulnerable groups that require attention during the COVD-19 pandemic. Using a qualitative descriptive research design, 12 transgender women and hijra persons participated in semi-structured telephone interviews during India’s lockdown phases (1.0 and 2.0) of the COVID-19 pandemic. A snowball sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Authors identified five themes: knowledge and practice; psychological domain; health conditions; individual and community experiences; and support. Findings offer broad insights into bolstering health concerns and access to healthcare services from public health and human rights perspective. An access to adequate healthcare services is a fundamental human right. The COVID-19 pandemic response without a human rights framework will have a major impact on the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals. Future studies of this population will illuminate unique considerations for healthcare workers while providing care to this neglected group."

Discussao: A terapia com inibidores de tirosinoquinase (TKI) em pacientes com LMC em fase cronica, em geral, nao implica em estado de imunossupressao significativa, e, ate o momento, nao ha evidencias que estes pacientes tenham maior risco de contrair infeccao por SARS-CoV-2 ou de apresentar a forma mais grave da doenca quando comparados com a populacao em geral. As recomendacoes atuais sao de manutencao do tratamento com TKI em formas leves da infeccao, e para casos graves, a interrupcao da terapia deve ser discutida individualmente. O efeitos adversos associados aos TKI, como hipertensao portal e derrame pleural, mais comumente vistos durante o uso de TKI de segunda geracao, como dasatinibe, podem agravar o quadro clinico da infeccao viral. Para estes pacientes (que apresentam evento adverso ao inibidor e desenvolver COVID-19) deve-se considerar interromper o TKI a fim de causar menor morbidade pulmonar. Em 2014, os TKI foram testados contra outros tipos de coronavirus. Imatinibe e dasatinibe mostraram-se ativos contra MERS-CoV e SARS-CoV, enquanto que nilotinibe foi ativo contra SARS-CoV. Os autores sugerem que a inibicao das vias de sinalizacao celular dependentes da tirosinoquinase ABL seja crucial para inibicao da replicacao viral. Ha um estudo em andamento, randomizado, controlado com placebo, para avaliacao da utilizacao de imatinibe em pacientes com COVID-19. Conclusao: Mediante o exposto, entendemos que apesar de todos os dados de literatura ate o momento demonstraram um perfil favoravel de evolucao em pacientes com LMC e infectados por SARS-Cov-2, outras variaveis devem ser consideradas na avaliacao individual do paciente. Juntos, todos os fatores podem contribuir para desfechos graves, como no relato apresentado.Copyright © 2020"
Multi-modality imaging of inflammation and ischemia for assessment of myocardial injury in Covid-19,
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: Clinical Outcome and Prognostic Correlates,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) poses a major threat to the health of people worldwide. We performed a retrospective case series analysis to assess clinical outcome and identify pretreatment prognostic correlates of SARS, managed under a standardized treatment protocol. We studied 127 male and 196 female patients with a mean age of 41±14 (range 18–83). All patients, except two, received ribavirin and steroid combination therapy. In 115 (36%) patients, the course of disease was limited. Pneumonitis progressed rapidly in the remaining patients. Sixty-seven (21%) patients required intensive care, and 42 (13%) required ventilator support. Advanced age, high admission neutrophil count, and high initial lactate dehydrogenase level were independent correlates of an adverse clinical outcome. SARS-associated coronavirus caused severe illnesses in most patients, despite early treatment with ribavirin and steroid. This study has identified three independent pretreatment prognostic correlates."
Coinfection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Bordetella bronchiseptica Pneumonia in a Renal Transplant Patient,"Bordetella species cause respiratory infections in both humans and animals. Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica) infection is an uncommon pathogen in humans. The clinical spectrum of infections with SARS-CoV-2 includes viral pneumonia of variable severity, with some patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring mechanical ventilation support. Transplant patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection have high mortality. Bacterial coinfection, including pneumonia, have been described in patients with COVID-19. We present a renal transplant patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed B. bronchiseptica superinfection and had a rapid clinical and radiological response to azithromycin treatment."
An agent-based computational framework for simulation of global pandemic and social response on planet X,"The increase in readily available computational power raises the possibility that direct agent-based modeling can play a key role in the analysis of epidemiological population dynamics. Specifically, the objective of this work is to develop a robust agent-based computational framework to investigate the emergent structure of Susceptible-Infected-Removed/Recovered (SIR)-type populations and variants thereof, on a global planetary scale. To accomplish this objective, we develop a planet-wide model based on interaction between discrete entities (agents), where each agent on the surface of the planet is initially uninfected. Infections are then seeded on the planet in localized regions. Contracting an infection depends on the characteristics of each agent—i.e. their susceptibility and contact with the seeded, infected agents. Agent mobility on the planet is dictated by social policies, for example such as “shelter in place”, “complete lockdown”, etc. The global population is then allowed to evolve according to infected states of agents, over many time periods, leading to an SIR population. The work illustrates the construction of the computational framework and the relatively straightforward application with direct, non-phenomenological, input data. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the model construction and the results of such an approach."
Kinase Inhibitors as Underexplored Antiviral Agents,"[Image: see text] Viral infections are a major health problem; therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Antivirals used to target proteins encoded by the viral genome usually enhance drug resistance generated by the virus. A potential solution may be drugs acting at host-based targets since viruses are dependent on numerous cellular proteins and phosphorylation events that are crucial during their life cycle. Repurposing existing kinase inhibitors as antiviral agents would help in the cost and effectiveness of the process, but this strategy usually does not provide much improvement, and specific medicinal chemistry programs are needed in the field. Anyway, extensive use of FDA-approved kinase inhibitors has been quite useful in deciphering the role of host kinases in viral infection. The present perspective aims to review the state of the art of kinase inhibitors that target viral infections in different development stages."
"Differential Genomic Profile in TERT, DSP, and FAM13A Between COPD Patients With Emphysema, IPF, and CPFE Syndrome","Background: Genetic association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with lasting lung diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), as well as the simultaneous presentation, known as Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema (CPFE) Syndrome. It is unknown if these diseases share genetic variants previously described in an independent way. This study aims to identify common or differential variants between COPD, IPF, and CPFE. Materials and methods: The association analysis was carried out through a case-control design in a Mexican mestizo population (n = 828); three patients' groups were included: COPD smokers (COPD-S, n = 178), IPF patients (n = 93), and CPFE patients (n = 16). Also, two comparison groups were analyzed: smokers without COPD (SWOC, n = 367) and healthy subjects belonging to the Mexican Pulmonary Aging Cohort (PAC, n = 174). Five SNPs in four genes previously associated to interstitial and obstructive diseases were selected: rs2609255 (FAM13A), rs2736100 (TERT), rs2076295 (DSP) rs5743890, and rs111521887 (TOLLIP). Genotyping was performed by qPCR using predesigned Taqman probes. Results: In comparing IPF vs. PAC, significant differences were found in the frequency of the rs260955 G allele associated with the IPF risk (OR = 1.68, p = 0.01). Also, the genotypes, GG of rs260955 (OR = 2.86, p = 0.01) and TT of rs2076295 (OR = 1.79, p = 0.03) were associated with an increased risk of IPF; after adjusting by covariables, only the rs260955 G allele remain significant (p = 0.01). For the CPFE vs. PAC comparison, an increased CPFE risk was identified since there is a difference in the rs2736100 C allele (OR = 4.02, p < 0.01; adjusted p < 0.01). For COPD-S, the rs2609255 TG genotype was associated with increased COPD risk after adjusting by covariables. Conclusion: The rs2736100 C allele is associated with decreased IPF risk and confers an increased risk for CPFE. Also, the rs2076295 TT genotype is associated with increased IPF risk, while the GG genotype is associated with CFPE susceptibility. The rs2609255 G allele and GG genotype are associated with IPF susceptibility, while the TG genotype is present in patients with emphysema."
Binding of SARS–CoV–2 to cell receptors: a tale of molecular evolution,"The magnified infectious power of the SARS–CoV–2 virus compared to its precursor SARS–CoV is intimately linked to an enhanced ability in the mutated virus to find available hydrogen bond sites in the host cells. This characteristic is acquired during virus evolution because of the selective pressure exerted at the molecular level. We pinpoint the specific residue (in the virus) to residue (in the cell) contacts during the initial recognition and binding and show that the virus· · · cell interaction is mainly due to an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and to a large surface of non–covalent interactions. In addition to the formal quantum characterization of bonding interactions, computation of absorption spectra for the specific virus· · · cell interacting residues yields significant shifts of ∆λ max = 47 and 66 nm in the wavelength for maximum absorption in the complex with respect to the isolated host and virus, respectively."
Internal quality assurance in diagnostic microbiology: A simple approach for insightful data,"Given the importance of microbiology results on patient care, high quality standards are expected. Internal quality assurance (IQA) could mitigate the limitations of internal quality control, competency assessment and external quality assurance, adding a longitudinal insight, including pre- and post-analytical steps. Here, we implemented an IQA program in our clinical microbiology facilities with blind resubmission of routine samples during 22 months. One-hundred-and-twenty-one out of 123 (98.4%) serological analyses and 112 out of 122 (91.8%) molecular analyses were concordant. Among the discordances in molecular biology analyses, 6 results were low positive samples that turned out negative, likely due to stochastic repartition of nucleic acids. Moreover, one identified retranscription error led us to implement automated results transmission from the Applied Biosystems instruments to the laboratory information system (LIS). Regarding Gram stain microscopy, 560 out of 745 (75.2%) of compared parameters were concordant. As many as 67 out of 84 (79.8%) pairs of culture results were similar, including 16 sterile pairs, 27 having identical identification or description and semi-quantification and 24 only showing variations in semi-quantification with identical description or identification of colonies. Seventeen pairs had diverging identification or description of colonies. Culture was twice only done for one member of the pairs. Regarding antibiotic susceptibility testing, a major discrepancy was observed in 5 out of 48 results (10.4%). In conclusion, serological tests were highly reproducible. Molecular diagnosis also revealed to be robust except when the amounts of nucleic acids present in the sample were close to the limits of detection. Conventional microbiology was less robust with major discrepancies reaching 39.5% of the samples for microscopy. Similarly, culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing were prone to discrepancies. This work was ground for reconsidering multiples aspects of our practices and demonstrates the importance of IQA to complete the other quality management procedures."
Using a Systems-Focused Simulation to Rapidly Prepare for Large Volume COVID-19 Vaccination,"SUMMARY STATEMENT: The goal of vaccinating large numbers of staff and nonstaff against COVID-19 with a novel vaccine necessitated rapid modifications to an existing workforce vaccination program. We performed a series of 3 iterative systems-focused simulations and debriefings in the span of 1 week to evaluate existing vaccination clinic space, trial a new physical space for the COVID-19 vaccine clinic, identify existing process gaps, and determine necessary changes for maximum efficiency and safety. By using iterative systems-focused simulations, we were able to perform a gap analysis on the existing program, develop and stabilize new processes, and focus on emergency preparedness."
Neurological complications after first dose of COVID-19 vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Emerging reports of rare neurological complications associated with COVID-19 infection and vaccinations are leading to regulatory, clinical and public health concerns. We undertook a self-controlled case series study to investigate hospital admissions from neurological complications in the 28 days after a first dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-19 (n = 20,417,752) or BNT162b2 (n = 12,134,782), and after a SARS-CoV-2-positive test (n = 2,005,280). There was an increased risk of Guillain–Barré syndrome (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 2.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15–3.92 at 15–21 days after vaccination) and Bell’s palsy (IRR, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.08–1.56 at 15–21 days) with ChAdOx1nCoV-19. There was an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (IRR, 1.38; 95% CI: 1.12–1.71 at 15–21 days) with BNT162b2. An independent Scottish cohort provided further support for the association between ChAdOx1nCoV and Guillain–Barré syndrome (IRR, 2.32; 95% CI: 1.08–5.02 at 1–28 days). There was a substantially higher risk of all neurological outcomes in the 28 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test including Guillain–Barré syndrome (IRR, 5.25; 95% CI: 3.00–9.18). Overall, we estimated 38 excess cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome per 10 million people receiving ChAdOx1nCoV-19 and 145 excess cases per 10 million people after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. In summary, although we find an increased risk of neurological complications in those who received COVID-19 vaccines, the risk of these complications is greater following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test."

Volatility forecasting of crude oil futures based on a genetic algorithm regularization online extreme learning machine with a forgetting factor: The role of news during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The outbreak of news and opinions during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in this age of rapid dissemination of information. The ensuing uncertainty has led to the emergence of heightened volatility in prices of crude oil futures. Whether such news has predictive value for the volatility of crude oil futures during the COVID-19 pandemic is examined in this research. We proposed a modeling framework, genetic algorithm regularization online extreme learning machine with forgetting factor (GA-RFOS-ELM), to estimate the effects of news during the COVID-19 pandemic on the volatility of crude oil futures. GA-RFOS-ELM could learn block-by-block with fixed or varying block size when considering the block own valid period. The experimental results illustrate that news during the COVID-19 pandemic has more predictive information, which is crucial for short-term volatility forecasting of crude oil futures. The novel approach illustrates that online update learning ability is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be effective and efficient in volatility forecasting of crude oil futures. The contributions of our study are significant for investors and administrators to predict and understand the behavior of volatility during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Pulmonary Diseases and Corticosteroids,"Steroids (corticosteroids) are anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids are used in many pulmonary conditions. Corticosteroids have a proven beneficial role in asthma, croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis), decreasing the risk and severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, interstitial lung disease, hemangioma of trachea, Pulmonary eosinophillic disorders. Role of corticosteroids is controversial in many conditions e.g. idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, bronchiolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hyperplasia of thymus, bronchiolitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration syndromes, atypical pneumonias, laryngeal diphtheria, AIDS, SARS, sarcoidosis, meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pulmonary haemorrhage, bronchitis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia in JRA, histiocytosis, á-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bordtella pertusis, pulmonary involvement in histiocytosis. However these are used empirically in many of these conditions despite lack of clear evidence in favour. There is concern about their side effects, especially on growth. Systemic steroids are associated with significant adverse effects. Pulmonary conditions have a strategic advantage that inhaled corticosteroids are useful in many of these. Although inhaled preparations of corticosteroids have been developed to maximise effective treatment of lung diseases characterised by inflammation and reduce the frequency of harmful effects, these have not been eliminated. There are situations where only systemic steroids are useful. Clinicians must weigh the benefits against the potential detrimental effects. It is recommended that standard protocols for use of steroids available in literature should be followed, always keeping a watch on the potential hazards of prolonged use."
Do we still need to do dual tracer localisation for sentinel node biopsy in patients with early breast cancer?,
Fusing Ambient and Mobile Sensor Features Into a Behaviorome for Predicting Clinical Health Scores,"Advances in machine learning and low-cost, ubiquitous sensors offer a practical method for understanding the predictive relationship between behavior and health. In this study, we analyze this relationship by building a behaviorome, or set of digital behavior markers, from a fusion of data collected from ambient and wearable sensors. We then use the behaviorome to predict clinical scores for a sample of n = 21 participants based on continuous data collected from smart homes and smartwatches and automatically labeled with corresponding activity and location types. To further investigate the relationship between domains, including participant demographics, self-report and external observation-based health scores, and behavior markers, we propose a joint inference technique that improves predictive performance for these types of high-dimensional spaces. For our participant sample, we observe correlations ranging from small to large for the clinical scores. We also observe an improvement in predictive performance when multiple sensor modalities are used and when joint inference is employed."
Exploring Knowledge Domain and Emerging Trends in Climate Change and Environmental Audit: A Scientometric Review,"Environmental audit is inevitably linked to climate change, one immediate target of the auditors is likely to be climate control, and the warming of the Earth and the consequent climatic changes affect us all. What is the link between environmental audit and climate change? What ties together some of these themes between environmental audit and climate change? The interaction between climate change and environmental audit has been one of the most challenging. In this paper, a scientometric analysis of 84 academic publications between 2013 and 2021 related to climate change and environmental audit is presented to characterize the knowledge domain by using the CiteSpace visualization software. First, we present the number of publications, the number of citations, research categories, and journals published through Web of Science database. Secondly, we analyze countries, authors, and journals with outstanding contributions through network analysis. Finally, we use keyword analysis and apply three types of knowledge mapping to our research, cluster view, timeline view, and time zone view, revealing the focus and future directions. We identify the most important topic in the field of climate change and environment audit as represented on the basis of existing literature data which include the Carbon Emissions, Social Capital, Energy Audit, Corporate Governance, Diffusion of Innovation Environmental Management System, and Audit Committee. The results show that climate change and environmental audit publications grew slowly, but the research are widely cited by scholars. Published journals are relatively scattered, but the cited journals are the world’s top journals, and most research countries are developed countries. The most productive authors and institutions in this subject area are in UK, Australia, USA, Spain, and Netherlands. There are no leading figures, but the content of their research can be divided into six clusters. Future research content involving city, policy, dynamics, information, biodiversity, conservation and clustering social capital, diffusion of innovation environmental management, and audit committee are the directions for future research. It is worth noting that cities, policies, and adaptability are closely linked to public health."
The ROX index can be a useful tool for the triage evaluation of COVID‐19 patients with dyspnoea,"AIM: To assess whether the application of a non‐invasive tool, such as ratio of oxygen saturation (ROX) index, during triage can identify patients with COVID‐19 at high risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). DESIGN: A multi‐centre, observational, retrospective study. METHODS: Only COVID‐19 positive patients who required an emergency department evaluation for dyspnoea were considered. The primary objective of the study was to compare the ROX value obtained during triage with the medical diagnosis of ARDS and intubation in 72 h of the triage evaluation. The ROX index value was also compared with objective outcomes, such as the pressure of arterial O(2) (PaO(2))/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio and the lung parenchyma volume involved in COVID‐19‐related inflammatory processes, based on 3D reconstructions of chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: During the study period, from 20 March 2020 until 31 May 2020, a total of 273 patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were enrolled. The predictive ability of ROX for the risk of developing ARDS in 72 h after triage evaluation was associated with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.845 (0.797–0.892, p < 0.001), whereas the AUROC value was 0.727 (0.634–0.821, p < 0.001) for the risk of intubation. ROX values were strongly correlated with PaO(2)/FiO(2) values (r = 0.650, p < 0.001), decreased ROX values were associated with increased percentages of lung involvement based on 3D CT reconstruction (r = −0.371, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ROX index showed a good ability to identify triage patients at high evolutionary risk. Correlations with objective but more invasive indicators (PaO(2)/FiO(2) and CT) confirmed the important role of ROX in identifying COVID‐19 patients with extensive pathological processes. IMPACT: During the difficult triage evaluation of COVID‐19 patients, the ROX index can help the nurse to identify the real severity of the patient. The triage systems could integrate the ROX in the rapid patient assessment to stratify patients more accurately."
The costs and benefits of primary prevention of zoonotic pandemics,"The lives lost and economic costs of viral zoonotic pandemics have steadily increased over the past century. Prominent policymakers have promoted plans that argue the best ways to address future pandemic catastrophes should entail, “detecting and containing emerging zoonotic threats.” In other words, we should take actions only after humans get sick. We sharply disagree. Humans have extensive contact with wildlife known to harbor vast numbers of viruses, many of which have not yet spilled into humans. We compute the annualized damages from emerging viral zoonoses. We explore three practical actions to minimize the impact of future pandemics: better surveillance of pathogen spillover and development of global databases of virus genomics and serology, better management of wildlife trade, and substantial reduction of deforestation. We find that these primary pandemic prevention actions cost less than 1/20th the value of lives lost each year to emerging viral zoonoses and have substantial cobenefits."
Electron Microscopy Identification of SARS-COV-2: What is the Evidence?,
Secondary structure determination of conserved SARS-CoV-2 RNA elements by NMR spectroscopy,"The current pandemic situation caused by the Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2) highlights the need for coordinated research to combat COVID-19. A particularly important aspect is the development of medication. In addition to viral proteins, structured RNA elements represent a potent alternative as drug targets. The search for drugs that target RNA requires their high-resolution structural characterization. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a worldwide consortium of NMR researchers aims to characterize potential RNA drug targets of SCoV2. Here, we report the characterization of 15 conserved RNA elements located at the 5′ end, the ribosomal frameshift segment and the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the SCoV2 genome, their large-scale production and NMR-based secondary structure determination. The NMR data are corroborated with secondary structure probing by DMS footprinting experiments. The close agreement of NMR secondary structure determination of isolated RNA elements with DMS footprinting and NMR performed on larger RNA regions shows that the secondary structure elements fold independently. The NMR data reported here provide the basis for NMR investigations of RNA function, RNA interactions with viral and host proteins and screening campaigns to identify potential RNA binders for pharmaceutical intervention."
Respiratory Protection against Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases,"Respiratory protection against airborne pathogens is crucial for pandemic/epidemic preparedness in the context of personal protection, healthcare systems, and governance. We expect that the development of technologies that overcome the existing challenges in current respiratory protective devices will lead to a timely and effective response to the next outbreak."
"Serosurvey of Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) in Dromedary Camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Laikipia County, Kenya","Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are an important protein source for people in semi‐arid and arid regions of Africa. In Kenya, camel populations have grown dramatically in the past few decades resulting in the potential for increased disease transmission between humans and camels. An estimated four million Kenyans drink unpasteurized camel milk, which poses a disease risk. We evaluated the seroprevalence of a significant zoonotic pathogen, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), among 334 camels from nine herds in Laikipia County, Kenya. Serum testing revealed 18.6% positive seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii (n = 344). Increasing camel age was positively associated with C. burnetii seroprevalence (OR = 5.36). Our study confirmed that camels living in Laikipia County, Kenya, have been exposed to the zoonotic pathogen, C. burnetii. Further research to evaluate the role of camels in disease transmission to other livestock, wildlife and humans in Kenya should be conducted."
"A joint analysis of influenza-associated hospitalizations and mortality in Hong Kong, 1998–2013","Influenza viruses may cause severe human infections leading to hospitalization or death. Linear regression models were fitted to population-based data on hospitalizations and deaths. Surveillance data on influenza virus activity permitted inference on influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths. The ratios of these estimates were used as a potential indicator of severity. Influenza was associated with 431 (95% CrI: 358–503) respiratory deaths and 12,700 (95% CrI: 11,700–13,700) respiratory hospitalizations per year. Majority of the excess deaths occurred in persons ≥65 y of age. The ratios of deaths to hospitalizations in adults ≥65 y were significantly higher for influenza A(H1N1) and A(H1N1)pdm09 compared to A(H3N2) and B. Substantial disease burden associated with influenza viruses were estimated in Hong Kong particularly among children and elderly in 1998–2013. Infections with influenza A(H1N1) was suggested to be more serious than A(H3N2) in older adults."
"The effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate on eating behaviour and homeostatic, reward and cognitive processes in women with binge-eating symptoms: an experimental medicine study","Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is the only drug currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Binge-Eating Disorder (BED), but little is known about the behavioural mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of LDX in treating BED. We examined the behavioural and neural effects of an acute dose of LDX (50 mg) in 22 women with binge-eating symptomatology using a randomised, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental medicine design. LDX reduced self-reported appetite ratings and intake of both a pasta meal and a palatable cookie snack. LDX also decreased the eating rate of pasta but not of cookies and reduced self-reported liking ratings for pasta at the end of the meal. When viewing food pictures during an fMRI scan, LDX reduced activity bilaterally in the thalamus. LDX enhanced sustained attention and reduced impulsive responding in a continuous performance task but had no effect on emotional bias or working memory. These results suggest the observed effects of LDX on food intake (and by implication the efficacy of LDX in treating BED) may be related to the actions of the drug to enhance satiety, reduce food-related reward responding when full and/or increase cognitive control. Novel pharmacotherapies for BED might be most effective if they have a broad spectrum of effects on appetite, reward and cognition."
Staff support during COVID-19 within an Acute Hospital Trust,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has put immense pressure on the National Health Service (NHS) and all healthcare professionals, not only physically but also mentally and the need to fully develop and implement a strategy to protect the mental health of healthcare professionals has never been more urgent. Research has demonstrated that staff can be supported by strengthening teams and offering frequent well-being support. AIMS: To assess the feedback from delivery of a strategy to provide psychological well-being support to NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this 'Support for Teams' initiative made a positive impact on staff and in what way. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used to gain quantitative and qualitative feedback from staff. Feedback was collected from two groups: Well-being Leads and clinicians providing support and resources to Well-being Leads. Feedback was collected via online forms. RESULTS: Collectively, feedback responses were received from 70 staff members. The majority of staff members felt supported and benefitted from the provisions provided. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation showed that our healthcare system must continue to proactively implement and adapt staff support strategies to protect the mental well-being of healthcare professionals, both in the context of future health crises and in everyday practice. This study will assist and guide development and adaptations to health and psychological well-being support, ahead of future pandemics and to provide suitable support beyond the COVID-19 pandemic."
The COVID-19 shock and long-term interest rates in emerging market economies,"Motivated by a divergent behavior of long-term sovereign bond yields across emerging market economies in the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we employ the Bayesian model averaging to uncover the country-specific factors that explain those differences. The most pronounced determinants of a country’s vulnerability to the COVID-19 shock were: (a) low GDP dynamics and (b) high sensitivity of bond yields to VIX in the period preceding the pandemic. Our results speak to the role of growth fundamentals in building-up the exposure to crises in emerging markets. They also signify a persistent differentiation of emerging economies by international investors."
"Angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE, ACE2) gene variants and COVID-19 outcome","The Angiotensin system is implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. First, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and expression of the ACE2 gene could regulate the individuaĺs susceptibility to infection. In addition, the balance between ACE1 and ACE activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases and could play a role in the severity of COVID-19. Functional ACE1/ACE2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and could thus also contribute to the outcome of COVID-19. We studied 204 COVID-19 patients (137 non-severe and 67 severe-ICU cases) and 536 age-matched controls. The ACE1 insertion/deletion and ACE2 rs2285666 polymorphism were determined. Variables frequencies were compared between the groups by logistic regression. We also sequenced the ACE2 coding nucleotides in a group of patients. Severe COVID-19 was associated with hypertension male gender (p<0.001), hypertension (p=0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p=0.046), and the ACE1-DD genotype (p=0.049). In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p=0.02, OR=2.26, 95%CI=1.12-4.63) and male gender (p=0.002; OR=3.15, 95%CI=1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence variants that could explain an increased risk of developing COVID-19. In conclusion, an adverse outcome of COVID-19 was associated with male gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and the ACE1 genotype. Our work suggested that the ACE1-I/D might influence COVID-19 severity, but the effect was dependent on the hypertensive status. This result requires further validation in other large cohorts."

"COVID-19 impact on labour relations in Palestine, the need for legal reform","OBJECTIVE: This research aims to examine how lawful the measures taken by employers against workers are in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to assess performance of the Ministry of Labour (MoL) and various trade unions in representing workers’ interests. METHODOLOGY: After an intensive literature review on the subject, 12 cases – representing different areas and economic sectors in the West Bank – were investigated. Then, free discussions were conducted with a focus group of 24 stakeholders (employers, employees, MoL representatives, trade union representatives, businessmen association representatives, lawyers, judges, and academics) to explore decisions made against employees, examine how lawful these decisions are, and present the evaluation of these groups to the MoL and trade unions. The discussions were followed by a quantitative questionnaire for 297 employees who were affected by unfair decisions and 87 employers representing different areas and sectors in the West Bank. A brainstorming session, involving two judges, two lawyers and four legal academics, was held to discuss research outcomes and benefit from their feedback and recommendations. RESEARCH PROBLEM: To demonstrate how lawful the measures taken by employers against workers are in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to assess performance of the MoL and various trade unions in representing workers’ interests. FINDINGS: The research paper reveals the illegality of the measures taken against employees in the context of responding to the economic effects of the pandemic. It reflects clear and significant dissatisfaction with the decisions made by trade unions and the MoL. The paper also recommends that some amendments need to be introduced to the Palestinian Labour Law. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This research paper pursues the illegality of decisions made by employers against workers in the context of addressing the economic losses caused by the pandemic. It concludes that ambiguous provisions of the Palestinian Labour Law were a main factor that allowed employers to abuse these decisions. The tripartite agreement organised by the MoL was against workers interest and gave rise to many legal and economic challenges. The need to review the structure and functioning of trade unions in the West Bank is highlighted in this research paper."
6-Methoxyflavone induces S-phase arrest through the CCNA2/CDK2/p21CIP1 signaling pathway in HeLa cells.,"This study aimed to elucidate the specific anticancer mechanism of 6-methoxyflavone in HeLa cells. A total of 178 putative targets of 6-methoxyflavone were obtained from the PharmMapper database. Microarray analyses, transcriptome sequencing analyses, functional enrichment analyses, and gene set enrichment analyses were performed to preliminarily explore the roles and mechanisms of the 178 targets in cervical cancer. Cell counting kit-8, cell cycle assays, polymerase chain reactions, and western blotting were used to clarify the mechanism of action of 6-methoxyflavone. Molecular docking and noncovalent interaction analyses were performed to further confirm the mechanism of action in three-dimensional structures. Functional enrichment analyses and gene set enrichment analyses indicated that high mRNA expression of cyclin A2 (CCNA2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) stimulated cell cycle progression in cervical cancer. Cell proliferation and cycle assays, transcriptome sequencing, polymerase chain reactions, and western blotting revealed that 6-methoxyflavone inhibited HeLa cell proliferation and induced S-phase arrest via the CCNA2/CDK2/ cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21CIP1) pathway. Molecular docking and noncovalent interaction analyses showed that 6-methoxyflavone had the strongest affinity toward, inhibitory effect on, and noncovalent interactions with CDK2, and that the combination of CDK2 and CCNA2 enhanced these effects. An analysis of clinical characteristics showed that 6-methoxyflavone might be related to six clinicopathological parameters of cervical cancer patients. 6-Methoxyflavone induces S-phase arrest in HeLa cells via the CCNA2/CDK2/p21CIP1 pathway."
56 Factors Predicting Admission in Pediatric and Young Adults With COVID-19,"Study Objectives: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19- its associated disease in humans- appears to cause more severe morbidity and mortality in older adults and geriatric patients than in children and young adults. There is growing recognition of the association between both race and obesity and disease severity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.However, the impact of age, race, and other major comorbidities on COVID-19 course in children and younger adults is not as well understood. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2656 patients under the age of 36 years with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and August 6, 2020 as reported to HEALTHeLINK, a regional health information system for western New York State. Subjects were split into pediatric (0-19 years) and young adult (20- 36 years) datasets. We evaluated the association between candidate risk factors (age, sex, race, calculated BMI/BMI percentile, smoking status, diabetes, pre-existing respiratory disease, hypertension, and sickle cell disease) using recursive partitioning and linear regression. The primary outcome was hospital admission, with length of stay being the secondary outcome Results: There were 2129 young adults and 527 pediatric patients who tested positive for COVID-19 during our study period. In our young adult population, race was the most significant predictor of admission, followed by BMI. African Americans with a BMI > 23 had the highest rate of admission (66%, p<0.001). Interestingly, Asian race was a strong predictor of outpatient management, regardless of BMI. Smoking status and hypertension were less significant predictors of admission, whereas sex, diabetes, preexisting respiratory conditions, and sickle cell disease were not significant. For our pediatric population, race was also the most significant predictor of admission, with African Americans being admitted at higher rates than Whites and Asians. In the pediatric population, however, BMI percentile for age was not a predictor of admission. In regards to the secondary outcome, admitted young adult with COVID-19 had an average length of stay of 1.4 days (SD ±2) while the admitted pediatric COVID-19 patients had an average length of stay of 1 day (SD ±1.1). African American race was associated with longer length of stay in both populations however, BMI was only significant in the young adult population. Conclusions: In a regional population of young adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19, race was strongly predictive of admission and length of stay. African American patients were most likely to be admitted, while Asian race was a strong predictor of outpatient management. For African American young adults, a BMI > 23 was the strongest additional predictor of admission. For younger patients with COVID-19 a simple decision tree that incorporates age, race, and BMI can help identify those patients least likely to need inpatient management. [Formula presented]"
Rational Use of Oxygen in COVID-19 Pandemic - Are We Doing Enough?,"During the episodes of large case surge of COVID-19, the health care system of many nations have struggled, more so in nations with resource limitations. Recently, Nepal and the neighboring nation India are being hit hard by the pandemic. Management of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 remains largely supportive, with oxygen therapy being the cornerstone of the management. Procurement, maintenance of oxygen supply system, coupled with avoiding misuse and wastage of oxygen is of paramount importance to better utilize the scarce resources amidst the peaks of a pandemic. Nepal needs to adopt policies to make best use of its oxygen stores and supplies with a collective effort from all stakeholders to save additional lives."

Abnormal singing can identify patients with right hemisphere cortical strokes at risk for impaired prosody,"Despite lacking aphasia seen with left hemisphere (LH) infarcts involving the middle cerebral artery territory, right hemisphere (RH) strokes can result in significant difficulties in affective prosody. These impairments may be more difficult to identify but lead to significant communication problems. We determine if evaluation of singing can accurately identify stroke patients with cortical RH infarcts at risk for prosodic impairment who may benefit from rehabilitation. A prospective cohort of 36 patients evaluated with acute ischemic stroke was recruited. Participants underwent an experimental battery evaluating their singing, prosody comprehension, and prosody production. Singing samples were rated by 2 independent reviewers as subjectively “normal” or “abnormal,” and analyzed for properties of the fundamental frequency. Relationships between infarct location, singing, and prosody performance were evaluated using t tests and chi-squared analysis. Eighty percent of participants with LH cortical strokes were unable to successfully complete any of the tasks due to severe aphasia. For the remainder, singing ratings corresponded to stroke location for 68% of patients. RH cortical strokes demonstrated a lower mean fundamental frequency while singing than those with subcortical infarcts (176.8 vs 130.4, P = 0.02). They also made more errors on tasks of prosody comprehension (28.6 vs 16.0, P < 0.001) and production (40.4 vs 18.4, P < 0.001). Patients with RH cortical infarcts are more likely to exhibit impaired prosody comprehension and production and demonstrate the poor variation of tone when singing compared to patients with subcortical infarcts. A simple singing screen is able to successfully identify patients with cortical lesions and potential prosodic deficits."
COVID‐19 in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: an Italian multicentre survey,
"Clinical course and outcome of 107 patients infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, discharged from two hospitals in Wuhan, China","BACKGROUND: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reported from Wuhan, China. Information on the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described. We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: A period of 7–13 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course. Age and male gender were independent risk factors for death of COVID-19."
Performance Evaluation of Construction Companies Using Integrated Entropy–Fuzzy VIKOR Model,"The construction sector plays an important role in a country’s economic development. The financial performance of a company is a good indicator of its financial health and status. In Malaysia, the government encourages the construction industry to develop an advanced infrastructure related to health, transport, education and housing. In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations and financial performance of construction sector companies have been affected recently. Additionally, uncertainty plays a vital role in the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process. Based on previous studies, there has been no comprehensive study conducted on the evaluation of the financial performance of construction companies by integrating entropy and fuzzy VIKOR models. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an MCDM model to evaluate and compare the financial performance of construction companies with an integrated entropy–fuzzy VIKOR model. A case study is carried out by evaluating the listed construction companies in Malaysia with the proposed model. The findings of this paper indicate that the company ECONBHD achieves the best financial performance over the study period. The significance of this paper is to determine the priority of the financial ratios and ranking of the construction companies with the proposed entropy–fuzzy VIKOR model."
Tenascin-C promotes bladder cancer progression and its action depends on syndecan-4 and involves NF-κB signaling activation.,"BACKGROUND Bladder Cancer (BCa) is a severe genitourinary tract disease with an uncertain pathology. Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironment plays a decisive role with respect to cancer progression, and that this is driven by tumor cell interactions with stromal components. Tenascin-C (TN-C) is an important extracellular matrix (ECM) component, which has been reported to be involved in other types of cancer, such as breast cancer. The expression of TN-C in BCa tissue has been reported to be positively associated with the BCa pathological grade, yet the presence of urine TN-C is considered as an independent risk factor for BCa. However, the role of TN-C in BCa progression is still unknow. Thus, the object of the present investigation is to determine the role of TN-C in BCa progression and the involved mechanism. METHODS In this study, expression of TN-C in BCa tissue of Chinese local people was determined by IHC. Patients corresponding to tumor specimens were flowed up by telephone call to get their prognostic data and analyzed by using SPSS 19.0 statistic package. In vitro mechanistic investigation was demonstrated by QT-qPCR, Western Blot, Plasmid transfection to establishment of high/low TN-C-expression stable cell line, Boyden Chamber Assay, BrdU incorporation, Wound Healing, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and ELISA. RESULTS TN-C expression in BCa tissue increases with tumor grade and is an independent risk factor for BCa patient. The in vitro investigation suggested that TN-C enhances BCa cell migration, invasion, proliferation and contributes to the elevated expression of EMT-related markers by activating NF-κB signaling, the mechanism of which involving in syndecan-4. CONCLUSIONS Expression of TN-C in BCa tissues of Chinese local people is increased according to tumor grade and is an independent risk factor. TN-C mediates BCa cell malignant behavior via syndecan-4 and NF-κB signaling. Although the mechanisms through which syndecan-4 is associated with the activation of NF-κB signaling are unclear, the data presented herein provide a foundation for future investigations into the role of TN-C in BCa progression."
How dendritic cells sense and respond to viral infections,"The ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to sense viral pathogens and orchestrate a proper immune response makes them one of the key players in antiviral immunity. Different DC subsets have complementing functions during viral infections, some specialize in antigen presentation and cross-presentation and others in the production of cytokines with antiviral activity, such as type I interferons. In this review, we summarize the latest updates concerning the role of DCs in viral infections, with particular focus on the complex interplay between DC subsets and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite being initiated by a vast array of immune receptors, DC-mediated antiviral responses often converge towards the same endpoint, that is the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of an adaptive immune response. Nonetheless, the inherent migratory properties of DCs make them a double-edged sword and often viral recognition by DCs results in further viral dissemination. Here we illustrate these various aspects of the antiviral functions of DCs and also provide a brief overview of novel antiviral vaccination strategies based on DCs targeting."
Use of Dexmedetomidine in Early Prone Positioning Combined With High-Flow Nasal Cannula and Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation in a COVID-19 Positive Patient,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to manifest in our society, we still lack evidence-based treatment guidelines. Current treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia has been modeled from currently established guidelines such as that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). COVID-19 pneumonia, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by severe hypoxia and near-normal respiratory system compliance with a time-related presentation. Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 receptor agonist that promotes sedative and anxiolytic effects without the risk of respiratory depression and can provide cooperative or semi-rousable sedation. Patients who are developing ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia have been treated with self-proning intervals in combination with supplementation of oxygenation via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV); however, a few patients have poor tolerance to the devices, leading to poor compliance and eventual worsening respiratory symptoms leading to intubation. In the current case report, we detail how a patient was able to successfully be self-proned with proper tolerance to HFNC and NIPPV while using dexmedetomidine, leading to discharge without the need for further oxygen supplementation at home."
Nasal Vaccine Delivery,"The mucosal surfaces represent the major site of entry of many pathogens, and major challenges in vaccine development include safety and stability in a suitable dosage form. Micro- and nanocarrier-based delivery systems as nasal vaccines induce humoral, cellular, and mucosal immunity. The nasal route of vaccination could also offer immunity at several distant mucosal sites (oral, rectal, vaginal, and pulmonary), which is considered a simplified and cost-effective mode of vaccination with enhanced patient compliance. Most of the nasal vaccine delivery systems in the form of microparticulates, nanoparticulates, and liposomes are currently under development and prove to offer immunity in animal models. The importance and potential of the nasal route of administration for vaccines is unexplored, and this chapter outlines the opportunities, challenges, and potential delivery solutions to facilitate the development of improved nasal vaccines for infectious diseases."
Public utility vehicle service quality and customer satisfaction in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The implementation of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected most businesses worldwide. The transportation business, specifically in the Philippines, has been heavily affected since only the healthcare and essential workers were allowed to leave their homes during the early stage of the pandemic. This paper aimed to explore the service quality of Public Utility Vehicles (PUV) in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing the SERVQUAL dimensions. A total of 564 participants answered an online questionnaire using the convenience sampling approach, consisting of 58 questions. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to derive the causal relationships between SERVQUAL dimensions, COVID-19 safety protocol, and customer satisfaction simultaneously. Out of the six dimensions, the SEM indicated that COVID-19 protocols, tangibility, and assurance variables were found to significantly affect PUV service quality and thus, customer satisfaction. This study is one of the first complete studies that analyzed the PUV service quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings could provide the government with an evaluation of the compliance of PUVs to the imposed COVID-19 protocols. Furthermore, the framework of this study could also be applied and extended in evaluating PUV worldwide."
Increased Shamal winds and dust activity over the Arabian Peninsula during the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020,"While anthropogenic pollutants have decreased during the lockdown imposed as an effort to contain the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), changes in particulate matter (PM) do not necessarily exhibit the same tendency. This is the case for the eastern Arabian Peninsula, where in March–June 2020, and with respect to the same period in 2016–2019, a 30 % increase in PM concentration is observed. A stronger than normal nocturnal low-level jet and subtropical jet over parts of Saudi Arabia, in response to anomalous convection over the tropical Indian Ocean, promoted enhanced and more frequent episodes of Shamal winds over the Arabian Peninsula. Increased surface winds associated with the downward mixing of momentum to the surface fostered, in turn, dust lifting and increased PM concentrations. The stronger low-level winds also favoured long-range transport of aerosols, changing the PM values downstream. The competing effects of reduced anthropogenic and increased dust concentrations leave a small positive signal (<5 W m(−2)) in the net surface radiation flux (R(net)), with the former dominating during daytime and the latter at night. However, in parts of the Arabian Gulf, Sea of Oman and Iran R(net) increased by >20 W m(−2) with respect to the baseline period, owing to a clearer environment and weaker winds. It is concluded that a reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to the lockdown does not necessarily go hand in hand with lower particulate matter concentrations. Therefore, emissions reduction strategies need to account for feedback effects in order to reach the planned long-term outcomes."

Multi–Criteria–Decision–Analysis (MCDA) for the Horizon Scanning of Health Innovations an Application to COVID 19 Emergency,"Aim: In this article, we aim to present a tool for the early assessment of medical technologies. This evaluation system was designed and implemented by the National Centre for HTA and the National Centre for Innovative Technologies of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Italy, in order to respond to an institutional commitment within the “Health Technologies Assessment Team” that was established to face the huge demand for the evaluation of Health Technologies during the pandemic event caused by COVID-19, with a smart and easy-to-use framework. Methods: Horizon scanning was conducted through a brief assessment carried out according to the multicriteria decision analysis methodology. Each HTA domain was attributed a score according to a pros/cons and opportunities/threats system, derived from evidence in the literature. Scores were weighted according to different perspectives. Scores were presented in a Cartesian graph showing the positioning according to the potential value and the perceived risk associated with the technology. Results: Two case studies regarding the early assessment were reported, concerning two specific technologies: an individual protection device and a contact tracking system."
"Medical Doctors Awareness, Perception, and Attitude towards COVID-19 in Bangladesh: A Cross sectional study","Objective: COVID-19 has emerged as a pandemic and during the first week of May Bangladesh has reported more than 10,000 cases. A lack of awareness and poor understanding of the disease may result in rapid transmission of the disease in Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the awareness, perception, and attitude towards COVID-19 among Bangladeshi medical doctors. Method: This cross sectional, web-based study was conducted with the help of an online questionnaire and sent to the doctors which comprised of a series of questions regarding demographics of the participants, symptoms and incubation period of COVID-19, mode of transmission, measures to prevent transmission, availability of training and personal protective equipment in Bangladeshi hospitals, and attitude of doctors towards the treatment of suspected patients with COVID-19. Results: Of 800 medical doctors, a total 545 completed the survey (response 68.13%). Among the participants, 52.3% were females, 72.8% were below 30 years of age, and majority (52.8%) were working outside the cities in the villages and rural areas. A total of 404 (74.1%) doctors reported the correct incubation period of COVID-19. Majority doctors were aware of the symptoms with mode of transmission of COVID-19, measures to prevent hospital transmission, along with ways of identifying suspected patients with COVID-19. However, more than 90% of the doctors reported of inadequate intensive care unit and ventilator facilities along with extreme scarcity of personal protective equipment in the hospitals. 65.7% doctors prefer avoid working with a COVID-19 patient and more than 50% doctors have expressed that they would send the suspected COVID-19 patients to designated hospitals without providing treatment. Conclusion: The health authorities should take appropriate training measures to increase the awareness of the medical doctors along with providing sufficient amount of personal protective equipment for the medical doctors and supporting staff before deploying them in hospitals."

"Modeling the Stability of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on Skin, Currency, and Clothing","A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the winter of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread around the world. The extent and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is far greater than previous coronaviruses that emerged in the 21st Century. Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Skin, currency, and clothing samples were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions and incubated at three different temperatures (4C, 22C, and 37C). Stability was evaluated at 0 hours (h), 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 72 h, 96 h, 7 days, and 14 days post-exposure. SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be stable on skin through the duration of the experiment at 4C (14 days). Virus remained stable on skin for at least 96 h at 22C and for at least 8h at 37C. There were minimal differences between the tested currency samples. The virus remained stable on the $1 U.S.A. Bank Note for at least 96 h at 4C while viable virus was not detected on the $20 U.S.A. Bank Note samples beyond 72 h. The virus remained stable on both Bank Notes for at least 8 h at 22C and 4 h at 37C. Clothing samples were similar in stability to the currency with the virus being detected for at least 96 h at 4C and at least 4 h at 22C. No viable virus was detected on clothing samples at 37C after initial exposure. This study confirms the inverse relationship between virus stability and temperature. Furthermore, virus stability on skin demonstrates the need for continued hand hygiene practices to minimize fomite transmission both in the general population as well as workplaces where close contact is common."
Poor correlation between antibody titers and neutralizing activity in sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects,"Plenty of serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed so far, thus documenting the importance of evaluating the relevant features of the immune response to this viral agent. The performance of these assays is currently under investigation. Amongst them, LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG by DiaSorin and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 cobas by Roche are currently used by laboratory medicine hospital departments in Italy and many other countries. In the present study, we have firstly compared two serologic tests on serum samples collected at two different time points from forty-six laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 subjects. Secondly, eighty-five negative serum samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were analyzed. Thirdly, possible correlations between antibody levels and the resulting neutralizing activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. Results revealed that both tests are endowed with low sensitivity on the day of hospital admission, which increased to 97.8 and 100% for samples collected after 15 days for DiaSorin and Roche tests, respectively. The specificity of the two tests ranges from 96.5 to 100%, respectively. Importantly, a poor direct correlation between antibody titers and neutralizing activity levels was evidenced in the present study."
Biomarkers of Coagulation and Inflammation in COVID-19–Associated Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine if biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation can help define coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–associated ischemic stroke as a novel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) subtype. METHODS: We performed a machine learning cluster analysis of common biomarkers in patients admitted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to determine if any were associated with AIS. Findings were validated using aggregate data from 3 large healthcare systems. RESULTS: Clustering grouped 2908 unique patient encounters into 4 unique biomarker phenotypes based on levels of c-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and partial thromboplastin time. The most severe cluster phenotype had the highest prevalence of AIS (3.6%, P<0.001), in-hospital AIS (53%, P<0.002), severe AIS (31%, P=0.004), and cryptogenic AIS (73%, P<0.001). D-dimer was the only biomarker independently associated with prevalent AIS with quartile 4 having an 8-fold higher risk of AIS compared to quartile 1 (P=0.005), a finding that was further corroborated in a separate cohort of 157 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and AIS. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19–associated ischemic stroke may be related to COVID-19 illness severity and associated coagulopathy as defined by increasing D-dimer burden."
Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (S) protein vesicular stomatitis virus pseudoparticle neutralization assays offer a reliable alternative to the conventional neutralization assay in human seroepidemiological studies,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic coronavirus that was identified in 2012. MERS-CoV infection in humans can result in an acute, severe respiratory disease and in some cases multi-organ failure; the global mortality rate is approximately 35 %. The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is a major target for neutralizing antibodies in infected patients. The MERS-CoV microneutralization test (MNt) is the gold standard method for demonstrating prior infection. However, this method requires the use of live MERS-CoV in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment. The present work describes the generation and validation of S protein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype particles (VSV-MERS-CoV-S) in which the VSV glycoprotein G gene has been replaced by the luciferase reporter gene, followed by the establishment of a pseudoparticle-based neutralization test to detect MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies under BSL-2 conditions. Using a panel of human sera from confirmed MERS-CoV patients, the VSV-MERS-CoV particle neutralization assay produced results that were highly comparable to those of the microneutralization test using live MERS-CoV. The results suggest that the VSV-MERS-CoV-S pseudotype neutralization assay offers a highly specific, sensitive and safer alternative method to detect MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in human sera."
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Infectious Diagnoses and Antibiotic Use in Pediatric Ambulatory Practices,
Comparing Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown and 6 Months After the Lockdown in Austria: A Longitudinal Study,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has repeatedly been reported to impair mental health. This longitudinal study evaluated mental health at the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic (t1) and 6 months later (t2) in Austria. Indicators of mental health were depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), sleep quality (ISI), perceived stress (PSS-10), as well as quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF) and well-being (WHO-5). In total, N = 437 individuals participated in both surveys (52.9% women). The number of participants with clinically relevant depressive, anxiety, or insomnia symptoms did not differ statistically significantly between t1 and t2 (p ≥ 0.48). The prevalence of moderate or severe (clinically relevant) (1) depressive symptoms changed from 18.3% to 19.7% (p = 0.48), (2) anxiety symptoms from 16.5 to 15.6% (p = 0.67), and insomnia from 14.6 to 15.6% (p = 0.69) from t1 to t2. Bonferroni-corrected t-tests showed that the stress level (PSS-10) decreased, and well-being (WHO-5) increased. However, effect sizes do not seem to be clinically relevant (Cohen‘s d < 0.2). Results suggest that detrimental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic persisted several months after its outbreak and the end of the lockdown measures, respectively. Regarding well-being and stress, there is a slight trend toward improvement."
The effect of water immersion on vection in virtual reality,"Research about vection (illusory self-motion) has investigated a wide range of sensory cues and employed various methods and equipment, including use of virtual reality (VR). However, there is currently no research in the field of vection on the impact of floating in water while experiencing VR. Aquatic immersion presents a new and interesting method to potentially enhance vection by reducing conflicting sensory information that is usually experienced when standing or sitting on a stable surface. This study compares vection, visually induced motion sickness, and presence among participants experiencing VR while standing on the ground or floating in water. Results show that vection was significantly enhanced for the participants in the Water condition, whose judgments of self-displacement were larger than those of participants in the Ground condition. No differences in visually induced motion sickness or presence were found between conditions. We discuss the implication of this new type of VR experience for the fields of VR and vection while also discussing future research questions that emerge from our findings."
COVID-19 & Chronic Renal Disease: Clinical characteristics & prognosis,"BACKGROUND: Patients on dialysis were susceptible to COVID-19 and were prone to severe clinical characteristics after infection; acute kidney injury was related to mortality in COVID-19 cases. Limited is known about the characteristics of COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease not requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). AIM: Evaluate clinical characteristics, course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who did not require RRT and those on dialysis. DESIGN: A two-center retrospective study. METHODS: 836 adult patients with COVID-19 (24 CKD not on dialysis; 15 dialysis-dependent CKD) were included. The study includes no patients with renal transplantation. Risk factors were explored. RESULTS: CKD not requiring RRT is an independent risk factor for in-hospital death [adjusted OR (aOR) 7.35 (95%CI 2.41-22.44)] and poor prognosis [aOR 3.01 (95%CI 1.23-7.33)]. Compared to COVID-19 cases without CKD, those with CKD not requiring RRT showed similar percentage of initial moderate cases (75.00% vs. 73.65%) but higher incidence of in-hospital neutrophilia (50.00% vs. 27.30%) or death (50.00% vs. 9.03%). The odds ratio of dialysis associated to mortality in CKD patients was 2.00 (95%CI 0.52-7.63), suggesting COVID-19 patients with dialysis-dependent CKD were at greater risk of in-hospital death. For COVID-19 patients with CKD not requiring RRT, statins reduced the risk of neutrophilia [OR 0.10 (95%CI 0.01-0.69)] while diuretics increased the risk of neutrophilia [OR 15.4 (95%CI 1.47-160.97)], although both showed no association to mortality. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with CKD presented high incidence of neutrophilia, poor prognosis and in-hospital death, with dialysis patients being more vulnerable."
Average and longest expected treatment times for ultraviolet light disinfection of rooms.,"BACKGROUND Planning Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) disinfection of operating rooms (ORs) is equivalent to scheduling brief OR cases. The study purpose was evaluation of methods for predicting surgical case duration applied to treatment times for ORs and hospital rooms. METHODS Data used were disinfection times with a 3-tower UV-C disinfection system in N=700 rooms each with ≥100 completed treatments. RESULTS The coefficient of variation of mean treatment duration among rooms was 19.6% (99% confidence interval [CI] 18.2%-21.0%); pooled mean 18.3 minutes among the 133,927 treatments. The 50th percentile of coefficients of variation among treatments of the same room was 27.3% (CI 26.3%-28.4%), comparable to variabilities in durations of surgical procedures. The ratios of the 90th percentile to mean differed among rooms. Log-normal distributions had poor fits for 33% of rooms. Combining results, we calculated 90% upper prediction limits for treatment times by room using a distribution-free method (e.g., 3rd longest of preceding 29 durations). This approach was suitable because, once UV-C disinfection started, the median difference between the duration estimated by the system and actual time was 1 second. CONCLUSIONS Times for disinfection should be listed as treatment of a specific room (e.g., ""UV-C main OR16""), not generically (e.g., ""UV-C""). For estimating disinfection time after single surgical cases, use distribution-free upper prediction limits, because of considerable proportional variabilities in duration."
Predictors of Family Dissatisfaction with Support During Neurocritical Care Shared Decision-Making,"BACKGROUND: There is a critical need to improve support for families making difficult shared decisions about patient care with clinicians in the neuroscience ICU (neuro-ICU). The aim of this study is to identify patient- and family-related factors associated with dissatisfaction with shared decision-making support among families of neuro-critically ill patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using survey data that had been collected from a consecutive sample of family members of patients in the neuro-ICU (one family member per patient) at two US academic centers. Satisfaction with shared decision-making support on ICU discharge had been measured among family members using one specific Likert scale item on the Family Satisfaction in the ICU 24 survey, a validated survey instrument for families of patients in the ICU. We dichotomized top-box responses for this particular item as an outcome variable and identified available patient- and family-related covariates associated with dissatisfaction (i.e., less than complete satisfaction) via univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Among 355 surveys, 180 (49.5%) of the surveys indicated dissatisfaction with support during decision-making. In a multivariate model, no preexisting characteristics of families or patients ascertainable on ICU admission were predictive of dissatisfaction. However, among family factors determined during the ICU course, experiencing three or fewer formal family meetings (odds ratio 1.93 [confidence interval 1.13–3.31]; p = 0.01) was significantly predictive of dissatisfaction with decisional support in this cohort with an average patient length of stay of 8.6 days (SD 8.4). There was also a trend toward a family’s decision to keep a patient as full code, without treatment limitations, being predictive of dissatisfaction (odds ratio 1.80 [confidence interval 0.93–3.51]; p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Family dissatisfaction with neuro-ICU shared decision-making support is not necessarily predicted by any preexisting family or patient variables but appears to correlate with participating in fewer formal family meetings during ICU admission. Future studies to improve family satisfaction with neurocritical care decision-making support should have broad inclusion criteria for participants and should consider promoting frequency of family meetings as a core strategy.

How can we address the ever-pressing need to 'green up' surgical practice in the National Health Service?,"Clinical practice has inadvertently changed after the COVID-19 pandemic and currently the need to provide sustainable surgical services is more pressing than ever. The National Health Service has committed to a long-term efficient plan to reduce carbon footprint but there is no detailed plan for surgical practice, the domain that contributes the most to hospital-derived pollution. A series of consecutive steps and measures ought to be taken, starting from a hybrid approach quantifying surgically attributed carbon footprint. Then, a variety of suggested measures can be widely discussed and accordingly applied on a wider or more local level. Appropriate training should always precede implementing new practices to ensure that staff is familiar with these. These measures cover a broad range and should be arranged on a patient-centred basis from preoperative preconditioning to an effective follow-up. The need for more intense research and implementation of enhanced recovery protocols is widely discussed. Also, the necessity of green research and reinvestment of materials and resources is highlighted. A change of philosophy from a cradle-to-grave approach to a repurposing approach is suggested. We are confident that a new era is dawning in surgical practice and teamwork is the key for providing greener surgical services."
"The mediation of perceived risk’s impact on destination image and travel intention: An empirical study of Chengdu, China during COVID-19","Perceived risk clearly impacts travel behavior, including destination selection and satisfaction, but it is unclear how or why its effect is only significant in certain cases. This is because existing studies have undervalued the mediating factors of risk aversion, government initiatives, and media influence as well as the multiple forms or dimensions of risk that can mask its direct effect. This study constructs a structural equation model of perceived risk’s impact on destination image and travel intention for a more nuanced model of the perceived risk mechanism in tourism, based on 413 e-questionnaires regarding travel to Chengdu, China during the COVID-19 pandemic, using the Bootstrap method to analyze suppressing effect. It finds that while perceived risk has a significant negative impact on destination image and travel intention, this is complexly mediated so as to appear insignificant. Furthermore, different mediating factors and dimensions of perceived risk operate differently according to their varied combinations in actual circumstances. This study is significant because it provides a theoretical interpretation of tourism risk, elucidates the mechanisms or paths by which perceived risk affects travel intention, and expands a framework for research on destination image and travel intention into the realms of psychology, political, and communication science. It additionally encourages people to pay greater attention to the negative impact of crises and focuses on the important role of internal and external responses in crisis management, which can help improve the effectiveness of crisis management and promote the sustainable development of the tourism industry."

Varying Presentations of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Temporarily Associated with COVID-19,"Background. A novel coronavirus identified in 2019 leads to a pandemic of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with important morbidity and mortality. Initially, children seemed minimally affected, but there were reports of cases similar to (atypical) Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, and evidence emerges about a complication named paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporarily associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Case Presentations. Two cases were compared and discussed demonstrating varying presentations, management, and evolution of MIS-C. These cases are presented to increase awareness and familiarity among paediatricians and emergency physicians with the different clinical manifestations of this syndrome. Discussion. MIS-C may occur with possible diverse clinical presentations. Early recognition and treatment are paramount for a beneficial outcome."
Group Testing Performance Evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 Massive Scale Screening and Testing,"The capacity of current molecular testing convention does not allow high-throughput and community level scans of COVID-19 infections. The diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row-column group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly."
Case Report: Postacute Rehabilitation of Guillain-Barré Syndrome and Cerebral Vasculitis-Like Pattern Accompanied by SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Introduction: The main clinical manifestation of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is respiratory issues. Neurological manifestations are being increasingly recognized, including febrile seizures, headache, dizziness, and myalgia, as well as encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, and acute peripheral nerve diseases. Cerebral vasculitis is rarely reported. We describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia complicated by flaccid tetraplegia due to Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) associated with a cerebral vasculitis-like pattern. Case description: A 62-year-old man was hospitalized for cough, fever, and severe respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. The chest Computerized Tomography (CT) showed images related to interstitial pneumonia and the subsequent nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the hospitalization, there was a progressive deterioration of the senses associated with areflexic flaccid tetraplegia. The treatment with high doses of immunoglobulin G (IgG) led to the immediate improvement of the general conditions and a partial response in terms of recovery of the upper limb and of the distal lower limb movements. Subsequently the patient was admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit, where he received an intensive rehabilitation treatment consisting of physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Two months later the patient was discharged at home and able to walk independently even for long distances thanks to the use of Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFO). Conclusion: In this report, we present the case of a patient with peripheral and central neurological damage occurred later severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2. The Immunoglobulin G therapy allowed the patient to benefit considerably from early rehabilitation, reaching the walking, increasing the independence in daily living tasks, and enabling safe discharge from hospital to home. Related neurologic complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection suffer a lack of understanding and further investigations should be conducted."
A novel statistical method predicts mutability of the genomic segments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has made the largest pandemic of the 21st century, with hundreds of millions of cases and tens of millions of fatalities. Scientists all around the world are racing to develop vaccines and new pharmaceuticals to overcome the pandemic and offer effective treatments for COVID-19 disease. Consequently, there is an essential need to better understand how the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is affected by viral mutations and to determine the conserved segments in the viral genome that can serve as stable targets for novel therapeutics. Here, we introduce a text-mining method to estimate the mutability of genomic segments directly from a reference (ancestral) whole genome sequence. The method relies on calculating the importance of genomic segments based on their spatial distribution and frequency over the whole genome. To validate our approach, we perform a large-scale analysis of the viral mutations in nearly 80,000 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 predecessor whole genome sequences and show that these results are highly correlated with the segments predicted by the statistical method used for keyword detection. Importantly, these correlations are found to hold at the codon and gene levels, as well as for gene coding regions. Using the text-mining method, we further identify codon sequences that are potential candidates for siRNA-based antiviral drugs. Significantly, one of the candidates identified in this work corresponds to the first seven codons of an epitope of the spike glycoprotein, which is the only SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptide without a match to a human protein."
The Kaiser Permanente Research Bank Cancer Cohort: a collaborative resource to improve cancer care and survivorship,"BACKGROUND: The Kaiser Permanente Research Bank (KPRB) is collecting biospecimens and surveys linked to electronic health records (EHR) from approximately 400,000 adult KP members. Within the KPRB, we developed a Cancer Cohort to address issues related to cancer survival, and to understand how genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors impact cancer treatment, treatment sequelae, and prognosis. We describe the Cancer Cohort design and implementation, describe cohort characteristics after 5 years of enrollment, and discuss future directions. METHODS: Cancer cases are identified using rapid case ascertainment algorithms, linkage to regional or central tumor registries, and direct outreach to KP members with a history of cancer. Enrollment is primarily through email invitation. Participants complete a consent form, survey, and donate a blood or saliva sample. All cancer types are included. RESULTS: As of December 31, 2020, the cohort included 65,225 cases (56% female, 44% male) verified in tumor registries. The largest group was diagnosed between 60 and 69 years of age (31%) and are non-Hispanic White (83%); however, 10,076 (16%) were diagnosed at ages 18–49 years, 4208 (7%) are Hispanic, 3393 (5%) are Asian, and 2389 (4%) are Black. The median survival time is 14 years. Biospecimens are available on 98% of the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The KPRB Cancer Cohort is designed to improve our understanding of treatment efficacy and factors that contribute to long-term cancer survival. The cohort’s diversity - with respect to age, race/ethnicity and geographic location - will facilitate research on factors that contribute to cancer survival disparities."
Sleep apnoea is a risk factor for severe COVID-19,"Objective: To investigate if obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19. To examine whether the risk for contracting COVID-19 is elevated among OSA patients. Design and setting: Registry based retrospective case-control study using Finnish nationwide health registries and the FinnGen Study cohort. Participants: Information regarding OSA diagnosis and COVID-19 infection was extracted from the FinnGen study (N=260,405) with a total of 305 patients who had a recorded PCR-validated COVID-19 infection including 26 (8.5%) individuals who were also OSA patients. Severe COVID-19 (N=83, 27.2%) was defined as an infection requiring hospitalization. Among the hospitalized individuals there were 16 (19.3%) with OSA diagnosis. In addition, we also included in our analysis previously reported risk factors for both severe COVID-19 or risk factors and comorbidities for OSA from FinnGen. Main outcome measures: OSA diagnosis, information concerning COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization, were derived from Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry, Causes of Death Registry and the National Infectious Diseases Registry. Results: We show that OSA is a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization independent from age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (p-unadjusted=1.04x10^-4, OR-adjusted=5.24 [95%CI 1.33 to 23.43], p-adjusted=0.022). OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19 (p=0.49). Conclusion: While an OSA patients risk of contracting COVID-19 is the same as non-OSA individuals, the OSA patients have a five-fold risk to be hospitalized when affected by COVID-19 than non-OSA individuals. Our findings suggest that, in assessment of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, OSA needs to be recognized as one of the comorbidity risk factors for developing a severe form of the disease."
Association of Plaque Inflammation With Stroke Recurrence in Patients With Unproven Benefit From Carotid Revascularization,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In pooled analyses of endarterectomy trials for symptomatic carotid stenosis, several subgroups experienced no net benefit from revascularization. The validated SCAIL score includes stenosis severity and inflammation measured by Positron-Emission Tomography (PET) and improves the identification of patients with recurrent stroke compared with lumen-stenosis alone. We investigated if the SCAIL score improves the identification of recurrent stroke in subgroups with uncertain benefit from revascularization in endarterectomy trials. METHODS: We did an individual-participant data pooled analysis of three prospective cohort studies (DUCASS, 2008-2011; BIOVASC, 2014-2018; Barcelona Plaque Study, 2015-2018). Eligible patients had a recent non-severe (modified Rankin Score≤3) anterior circulation ischaemic stroke/TIA and either: ipsilateral mild carotid stenosis (<50%); ipsilateral moderate carotid stenosis (50-69%) plus at least one of female sex, age <65 years, diabetes mellitus, TIA, or delay >14 days to revascularization; or monocular loss of vision. Patients underwent co-registered carotid 18F-FDG PET/CT angiography (≤7 days from inclusion). The primary outcome was 90-day ipsilateral ischaemic stroke. Multivariable Cox regression modelling was performed. RESULTS: We included 135 patients. All patients started optimal modern-era medical treatment at admission and 62 (45.9%) underwent carotid revascularization (36 within the first 14 days and 26 beyond). At 90 days, 18 (13.3%) patients had experienced at least one stroke recurrence. The risk of recurrence increased progressively according to the SCAIL score (0.0% in patients scoring 0-1, 15.1% scoring 2-3 and 26.7% scoring 4-5; p=0.04). The adjusted (age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, carotid revascularization, antiplatelets and statins) Hazard Ratio for ipsilateral recurrent stroke per 1-point SCAIL increase was 2.16 (95% CI 1.32-3.53; p=0.002). A score ≥2 had a sensitivity of 100% for recurrence. DISCUSSION: The SCAIL score improved the identification of early recurrent stroke in subgroups that did not experience benefit in endarterectomy trials. Randomized trials are needed to test if a combined stenosis-inflammation strategy will improve selection for carotid revascularization where benefit is currently uncertain. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with recent anterior circulation ischemic stroke who do not benefit from carotid revascularization, the SCAIL score accurately distinguishes those at risk for recurrent ipsilateral ischemic stroke."
Septicaemia with deep venous thrombosis and necrotising pneumonia caused by acute community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in an infant with a three-year follow-up: a case report,"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a common pathogen that usually causes bacteraemia, osteomyelitis, as well as skin and soft tissue infections. However, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and necrotising pneumonia are rare in infants. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a one-month-five-day-old girl who was hospitalised for DVT and necrotising pneumonia due to septicaemia associated with Staphylococcus aureus. She recovered after treatment with intravenous antibiotics and multiple anticoagulant therapy, but DVT persisted at the three-year follow-up. Collateral circulation around the DVT was well-formed. Post thrombotic syndrome was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus complicated by DVT and necrotising pneumonia is rare and can be successfully treated."
Developing more detailed taxonomies of tobacco industry political activity in low-income and middle-income countries: qualitative evidence from eight countries,"INTRODUCTION: Historical evidence, predominantly from high-income countries (HICs), shows that the tobacco industry uses a recurring set of arguments and techniques when opposing tobacco control policies. This data formed the basis of a model of tobacco industry political activity known as the policy dystopia model (PDM). The PDM has been widely used in tobacco control research and advocacy and has subsequently been shown relevant to other unhealthy commodities industries in both HICs and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Before it can be validated as a generic tool for researching corporate influence on policy, one needs to determine whether the PDM successfully captures contemporary corporate political activities in LMICs. METHOD: We conducted semistructured interviews with 22 LMIC-based advocates and used the transcripts as the primary data source. The discursive and instrumental taxonomies constituting the PDM served as the starting point for the coding framework. Using thematic analysis, we combined deductive and inductive coding to ensure we captured all strategies from the PDM and the interviews. RESULTS: This study found that the tobacco industry uses a set of discursive and instrumental strategies that is largely consistent across LMICs and with the PDM. We identified several minor contextual nuances absent from the PDM. Some of these nuances were characteristic to individual countries, while others to LMICs more broadly. They included the argument that tobacco control policies unfairly punish reputable tobacco industry actors, and an emphasis on instrumental strategies centred around maintaining a good image, rather than rehabilitating a tarnished image as emphasised in the PDM. CONCLUSIONS: Allowing for the nuances identified in this study, the PDM has been found to be fit for purpose. The revised model should now be tested through in-depth LMIC case studies and could be used to facilitate comparative studies of unhealthy commodity industries’ political activities."
Can roflumilast become steroid-sparing alternative in the treatment of COVID-19?,"According to WHO the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to come. Despite of the exceptional measures being undertaken by regulatory agencies to expedite vaccine development, we may be several months if not years away from an effective vaccine. In such unprecedented times, the only resort nations have at their disposal is to identify and repurpose existing drugs against COVID-19 based on their known clinical or pharmacological profile which can provide direct or corroborative evidence of favorable benefit:risk in the management of COVID-19. Immune-mediated inflammation remains the hallmark of severe complications related to COVID-19 and while corticosteroids have shown preliminary evidence of benefit, they can act like a double-edged sword for majority of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, there is a need to identify ‘non-steroid’ potent and safe anti-inflammatory agents for use in therapeutic armamentarium against COVID-19. This article makes a case for one such existing drug, roflumilast, that can emerge as a steroid-sparing alternative against COVID-19."

Some actions for behavior analyst licensing bodies to consider in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic,"The COVID‐19 global pandemic has had a significant impact on the practice of applied behavior analysis (ABA). Practitioners and caregivers have had to adapt quickly as physical distancing, stay‐at‐home orders, and shelter‐in‐place directives have become commonplace. As the field copes with the changes produced by the COVID‐19 outbreak, many behavior analytic practitioners are seeking guidance from regulatory bodies to ensure they are practicing legally and ethically. This article outlines some actions that the regulatory bodies that manage state behavior analyst licensure programs may consider to assist ABA practitioners and consumers during this unprecedented time. Additionally, suggestions are offered as to how state licensing bodies might prepare to support the practice of licensees during future events that present challenges similar to the current pandemic."
Threshold dynamics of difference equations for SEIR model with nonlinear incidence function and infinite delay,"In this research, we explore the global conduct of age-structured SEIR system with nonlinear incidence functional (NIF), where a threshold behavior is obtained. More precisely, we will analyze the investigated model differently, where we will rewrite it as a difference equations with infinite delay by the help of the characteristic method. Using standard conditions on the nonlinear incidence functional that can fit with a vast class of a well-known incidence functionals, we investigated the global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) using a Lyapunov functional (LF) for [Formula: see text] . The total trajectory method is utilized for avoiding proving the local behavior of equilibria. Further, in the case [Formula: see text] we achieved the persistence of the infection and the GAS of the endemic equilibrium state (EE) using the weakly [Formula: see text] -persistence theory, where a proper LF is obtained. The achieved results are checked numerically using graphical representations."
404 Acute coronary syndromes after healing from COVID-19: report of the initial observation,"AIMS: Severe pulmonary complications are well described in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been documented as well. Most patients (pts) recover quickly; nevertheless, the potential long-term cardiovascular sequalae of COVID-19 remain currently unknown. The aim was to report cases of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) after healing from COVID-19 and their features at coronary angiography; secondary purpose was to hypothesize the underlying mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective study was performed by acquiring data from the electronic medical record. From January to June 2021, four hypertensive pts (64 ± 17 years old; three males) with no history of CVDs and previous symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean interval from first positive molecular swab 47 ± 32 days; all recovered after 15 days with double negative swab) were admitted to the emergency department for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (3 anterior and one inferior). At admission, the SARS-CoV-2 molecular swab tested negative, left ventricle ejection fraction was 42 ± 12%, troponin T and Nt-proBNP values were 47 ± 24 ng/l and 1180 ± 978 ng/l, respectively. Emergency coronary angiography showed single-vessel acute thrombotic occlusion (in three cases of the anterior descending artery and in one case of the right coronary artery), with no evidence of atherosclerotic disease. Because of the high thrombotic burden, in all cases a mechanical thrombus aspiration system was used, tirofiban infusion started and no balloon angioplasty or drug-eluting stent implantation was necessary (Figures A–D). After 72 h, a second SARS-CoV-2 molecular swab tested also negative. In the following days, the pts gradually recovered and they were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: These cases deserve specific considerations both on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the ACS possibly related to SARS-CoV-2 and on the subsequent long-term sequelae. Among various pathophysiologic mechanisms proposed, the high affinity of the spike protein for the angiotensin converting enzyme two receptor (expressed by both cardiac and endothelial cells) could explain direct cardiac viral infection and vasculitis with possible development of thrombosis. The latter could contribute both to acute and long-term cardiac sequelae, even months after the acute infection, configuring a sort of ‘cardiac post-Covid syndrome’. Whether and how long this status persists, making COVID-19 a risk factor for subsequent CVDs, is still an unresolved question. In this regard, continuous monitoring of these pts and larger future studies will be essential. [Image: see text]"
Bibliometric analysis of peruvian scientific output on COVID-19.,"OBJECTIVE To describe the Peruvian scientific output on COVID-19 up to January 31, 2021. MATERIALS AND METHODS We carried out a bibliometric study using two databases (MEDLINE and SciELO). We included original or short original articles with at least one author with Peruvian institutional affiliation. Scientific output was described according to: institution, approval by a Research Ethics Committee, registration in the platforms established by regulations, scientific journals in which they were published, research funding, and Peruvian collaboration networks. RESULTS A total of 106 articles were analyzed, only three (2.8%) were clinical trials. Of the top 10 institutions with the highest scientific output, only two did not belong to the education sector. A total of 53 (50.0%) articles had no information regarding ethical aspects or it was not explicitly stated whether or not it was approved by a Research Ethics Committee. Only 8 (7.7%) of 104 articles were registered in PRISA; 12 (11.3%) articles were published in Peruvian journals. Regarding funding, 71 (67.0%) investigations did not specify the source or they were self-financed. We found international collaboration in 70 publications (66.0%). CONCLUSIONS The most productive Peruvian institutions are found in Lima. Half of the articles did not state ethical aspects in any part of the document. Almost all of the studies were not registered on the platforms established by regulations. In more than half of the articles the source of funding is not stated or they were self-financed."
Mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinone: A potential treatment for COVID-19,"Immune dysregulation characterized by T cell exhaustion and high level of inflammatory cytokines is associated with severe COVID-19. Figuring out the early event of immune dysregulation would provide a potential treatment for COVID-19. Recent evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in the development of COVID-19 and may be responsible for the dysregulated immune response. Mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ), a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, shows beneficial effects on various diseases through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesize that MitoQ could act as a potential treatment in COVID-19. MitoQ may alleviate cytokine storm and restore the function of exhausted T cells in COVID-19 patients through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. In this article, we provide evidence to support the use of MitoQ as a potential treatment or adjunct therapy in the context of COVID-19."
Phytochemicals of Rhus spp. as Potential Inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease: Molecular Docking and Drug-Likeness Study,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in China and spread to cover the entire world with an ongoing pandemic. The magnitude of the situation and the fast spread of the new and deadly virus, as well as the lack of specific treatment, led to a focus on research to discover new therapeutic agents. AIM: In this study, we explore the potential inhibitory effects of some active polyphenolic constituents of Rhus spp. (sumac) against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme (M(pro); 6LU7). METHODS: 26 active polyphenolic compounds of Rhus spp. were studied for their antiviral activity by molecular docking, drug likeness, and synthetic accessibility score (SAS) as inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). RESULTS: The results show that all tested compounds of sumac provided good interaction with the main active site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), with better, lower molecular docking energy (kcal/mol) compared to the well-known drugs chloroquine and favipiravir (Avigan). Only six active polyphenolic compounds of Rhus spp. (sumac), methyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate, (Z)-1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxyprop-2-en-1-one, (Z)-2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-6-hydroxybenzofuran-3(2H)-one, 3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-4H-chroman-4-one, and 3,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-4-one, were proposed by drug likeness, solubility in water, and SAS analysis as potential inhibitors of M(pro) that may be used for the treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Six phenolic compounds of Rhus spp. are proposed for synthesis as potential inhibitors against M(pro) and have potential for the treatment of COVID-19. These results encourage further in vitro and in vivo investigations of the proposed ligands and research on the preventive use of Rhus spp. against SARS-CoV-2."

Protein analysis based on molecular beacon probes and biofunctionalized nanoparticles,"With the completion of the human genome-sequencing project, there has been a resulting change in the focus of studies from genomics to proteomics. By utilizing the inherent advantages of molecular beacon probes and biofunctionalized nanoparticles, a series of novel principles, methods and techniques have been exploited for bioanalytical and biomedical studies. This review mainly discusses the applications of molecular beacon probes and biofunctionalized nanoparticles-based technologies for real-time, in-situ, highly sensitive and highly selective protein analysis, including the nonspecific or specific protein detection and separation, protein/DNA interaction studies, cell surface protein recognition, and antigen-antibody binding process-based bacteria assays. The introduction of molecular beacon probes and biofunctionalized nanoparticles into the protein analysis area would necessarily advance the proteomics research."

POSA2 Clinical Features and Management of COVID 19 in Saudi Arabia,"Objectives: This study aims to identify clinical features of COVID 19 in hospitalized patients, comorbidities, complications, mortality rate, laboratory findings, and efficacy of the treatment. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in one tertiary hospital in the southern region of Saudi Arabia between January to December 2020. Data were extracted from patients’ medical records, including gender, age, weight, nationality, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, days of word admission, ICU stay, connecting on a mechanical ventilator, initial laboratory test, and medications. Results: Among 202 hospitalized patients, the mean age was 53.39 ± 18.20, 118 were male (58.4%) and 84 females (41.6%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (51.5%), diabetes mellitus (50.5%), and obesity (25.7%). The result showed most common signs and symptoms were shortness of breath (90.6%), cough (78.7%), fever (70.3%). The most frequent abnormal laboratory findings were d-dimer (67.3%), ferritin (59.9%), neutrophil count (43%), WBC (38.6%), c reactive protein (33.2%). Majority of patients received favipiravir (78.2%), tocilizumab (50.5%), dexamethasone (74.3%), enoxaparin (71.8%), cholecalciferol (89.1%), ascorbic acid (76.7%) and zinc sulfate (75.2%). The complications were ARDS (38.1%), AKI (17,8%), septic shock (10.9%), 45%of the patients admitted to ICU and 39.1% required ventilator, so the mortality rate was 31.7% and cure rate (68.3%). Conclusions: This study demonstrated signs and symptoms, abnormal laboratory results, complications, and a high mortality rate of hospitalized COVID 19 patients in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. The use of ICU was high among the study population. The mortality rate was high especially for patients with pre-existing conditions. However, a small number of COVID 19 death occurred in healthy adults with no underlying health conditions. Further national studies are needed to generalized these results and to assess the efficacy of the treatment."
Replication of LZTFL1 gene region as a susceptibility locus for COVID-19 in Latvian population.,"The severity of COVID-19 disease is partly determined by host genetic factors that have been reported by GWAS. We evaluated nine previously reported genome-wide significant associations regardless of the disease severity in a representative sample from the population of Latvia. Our cohort consisted of 475 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, from which 146 were hospitalized individuals and 2217 controls. We found three variants from Neanderthal introgression event at the 3p21.31 region to be significantly associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization status. The strongest association was displayed by rs71325088 with Bonferroni adjusted P=0.007, OR=1.46 [95% CI 1.17-1.81]. We performed fine-mapping by exploring 1 Mb region at 3p21.31 locus and identified 9 SNPs with even lower p-values with the strongest association estimated for rs2191031 P=5e-05, OR = 1.40[CI 95% 1.19-1.64] located in the LZTFL1. We show clear replication of 3p.21.31 locus in an independent cohort which favors further functional investigation of leading variants."
Impact of COVID-19 on otolaryngology head & neck speciality and residency program in Saudi Arabia,"The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), has rapidly swept worldwide since its identification in December 2019. As the spread of the disease accelerated both in Wuhan and elsewhere globally, the WHO declared it a pandemic. There is sound evidence to argue that otolaryngologists run high risks of occupational SARS-COV2 among health care workers due to high viral load in upper respiratory examinations. This review article was conducted to determine the effect of the COVID 19 pandemic on the otolaryngology department and residency program in Saudi Arabia. Since the pandemic outbreak, the government of Saudi Arabia has taken severe measures and issued several decisions to limit the spread of the virus. These decisions included operations, procedures, outpatient clinics by prioritizing emergency and time-sensitive cases while rescheduling all electives and routines once. As a result, the residency program was also affected by the substantial reduction of daily surgical activity and preventing endoscopic tests in the clinics, which led to a notable decrease in residents' involvement and risk of procedural skills deterioration which became a concern to many doctors of residency programs. It is difficult to deny that the epidemic will negatively impact. However, adhering to well-prepared guidelines and giving residents an excellent opportunity to overcome the defects will deliver training and patients' care while also protecting safety and health."
Entrepreneurial entry: The role of social media,"Despite the exponential growth of social media use, whether and how social media use may affect entrepreneurial entry remains a key research gap. In this study we examine whether individuals’ social media use influences their entrepreneurial entry. Drawing on social network theory, we argue that social media use allows individuals to obtain valuable social capital, as indicated by their offline social network, which increases their entrepreneurial entry. We further posit the relationship between social media use and entrepreneurial entry depends on individuals’ trust propensity based on the nature of social media as weak ties. Our model was supported by a nationally representative survey of 18,873 adults in China over two years. As the first paper on the role of social media on entrepreneurial entry, we hope our research highlights and puts forward research intersecting social media and entrepreneurship."
572. Real-world Effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines against Hospitalizations and Deaths in a Retrospective Cohort,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 vaccines after two doses needs to be demonstrated beyond clinical trials. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort assembled from a cross-institution comprehensive data repository, established patients of the health care system were categorized as having received no doses, one dose or two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine through April 4, 2021. Outcomes were COVID-19 related hospitalization and death. RESULTS: Of 94,018 patients 27.7% had completed two doses and 3.1% had completed one dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The two dose group was older with more comorbidities. 1.0% of the two dose group had a COVID-19 hospitalization, compared to 4.0% and 2.7% in the one dose and no dose groups respectively. The adjusted Cox proportional-hazards model based vaccine effectiveness after two doses (vs. no dose) was 96%(95% confidence interval(CI):95–97), compared to 78%(95%CI:76–82) after one dose. After two doses, vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19 mortality was 97.9%(95%CI:91.7–99.5), and 53.5%(95%CI:0.28–80.8) after one dose. Vaccine effectiveness at preventing hospitalization was conserved across age, race, ethnicity, Area Deprivation Index and Charlson Comorbidity Indices. Cohort Enrollment and Distribution by Immunization Status and Vaccine effectiveness against mortality [Image: see text] Cohort members are described by their immunization status and hospitalization at the end of the study period ending April 4th, 2021. Percentages compare this population to the total established patients. Each group is then divided into when hospitalized events occurred across immunization status. These percentages compare the number of events to the population in the immunization status at the end of the analysis period. Odds ratios for mortality were calculated and vaccine effectiveness calculated as 1 minus odds ratio times 100%. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In a large, diverse US cohort, receipt of two doses of an mRNA vaccine was highly effective in the real-world at preventing COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths with a substantive difference in effectiveness between one and two doses.

A sliding-window based algorithm to determine the presence of chest compressions from acceleration data,"This publication presents in detail five exemplary cases and the algorithm used in the article (Orlob et al. 2022). Defibrillator records for the five exemplary cases were obtained from the German Resuscitation Registry. They consist of accelerometry, electrocardiogram and capnography time series as well as defibrillation times, energies and impedance when recorded. For these cases, experienced physicians annotated time points of cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation or termination of resuscitation attempts, as well as the beginning and ending of every single chest compression period in consensus, as described in Orlob et al. (2022). Furthermore, an algorithm was developed which reliably detects chest compression periods automatically without the time-consuming process of manual annotation. This algorithm allows for an usage in automatic resuscitation quality assessment, machine learning approaches, and handling of big amounts of data (Orlob et al. 2022)."
Protection against herpes simplex virus type 2 infection in a neonatal murine model using a trivalent nucleoside-modified mRNA in lipid nanoparticle vaccine,"Neonatal herpes is a dreaded complication of genital herpes infection in pregnancy. We recently compared two vaccine platforms for preventing genital herpes in female mice and guinea pigs and determined that HSV-2 glycoproteins C, D and E expressed using nucleoside-modified mRNA in lipid nanoparticles provided better protection than the same antigens produced as baculovirus proteins and administered with CpG and alum. Here we evaluated mRNA and protein immunization for protection against neonatal herpes. Female mice were immunized prior to mating and newborns were infected intranasally with HSV-2. IgG binding and neutralizing antibody levels in mothers and newborns were comparable using the mRNA or protein vaccines. Both vaccines protected first and second litter newborns against disseminated infection based on virus titers in multiple organs. We conclude that both vaccines are efficacious at preventing neonatal herpes, which leaves the mRNA vaccine as our preferred candidate based on better protection against genital herpes."
UV-C irradiation is able to inactivate pathogens found in commercially collected porcine plasma as demonstrated by swine bioassay,"Liquid porcine plasma is an animal origin raw material for the manufacturing process of spray-dried porcine plasma that is used in pig nutrition worldwide. In previous studies we found that the application of ultraviolet light C (UV-C) in liquid plasma that was inoculated with a variety of bacteria or viruses of importance in the swine industry can be considered as redundant safety steps because in general achieve around 4 logs reduction for most of these pathogens. However, the final validation of the UV-C light as safety feature should be conducted with commercial liquid plasma and using the pig bioassay model. As a first objective, the potential infectivity of a raw liquid plasma product collected from an abattoir was tested by means of a swine bioassay. We used Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), a ubiquitous virus that has been systematically detected by PCR in porcine plasma at abattoirs as selection criteria for commercial liquid plasma lot. As a second aim of the study, the effects of different doses of UV-C irradiation on the selected raw liquid plasma were assayed in the animal bioassay. Moreover, other swine infecting agents, including Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were also determined in the original plasma and monitored in the inoculated animals. Pigs negative for PCV-2 and PRRSV genome and antibodies were allotted to one of five groups (6 to 8 pigs/ group) and injected intra-peritoneally with 10 mL of their assigned inoculum at 50 d of age. Negative control pigs (group 1) were injected with PBS. Positive control pigs (group 5) were injected with a PCV-2 inoculum. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were injected with liquid porcine plasma that had been subjected to 0 (raw plasma), 3000 or 9000 J/L UV-C irradiation, respectively. Group 2 pigs (0 J/L UV-C) got infection by PRRSV but no PCV-2 infection or seroconversion. However, one pig from group 2 seroconverted to Rotavirus A (RVA) and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and three group 2 pigs seroconverted to Porcine parvovirus (PPV). Groups 1, 3 and 4 pigs showed no evidence of infection or seroconversion associated with the tested viruses or any other pathogens found in the liquid plasma before UV-C irradiation. Group 5 pigs developed PCV-2 infectivity as expected. UV-C irradiation of liquid plasma at 3000 and 9000 J/L was effective in preventing PRRSV and other pathogens transmission. Moreover, raw liquid plasma was non-infectious for PCV-2 in naïve pigs."

"ACE gene variants rise the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or diabetes. A pilot study","Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues to scale and threaten human health and public safety. It is essential to identify those risk factors that lead to a poor prognosis of the disease. A predisposing host genetic background could be one of these factors that explain the interindividual variability to COVID-19 severity. Thus, we have studied whether the rs4341 and rs4343 polymorphisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene, key regulator of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS), could explain the different outcomes of 128 COVID-19 patients with diverse degree of severity (33 asymptomatic or mildly asymptomatic, 66 hospitalized in the general ward, and 29 admitted to the ICU). We found that G allele of rs4341 and rs4343 was associated with severe COVID-19 in hypertensive patients, independently of gender (p<0.05). G-carrier genotypes of both polymorphisms were also associated with higher mortality (p< 0.05) and higher severity of COVID-19 in dyslipidemic (p<0.05) and type 2 diabetic patients (p< 0.01). In conclusion, our preliminary study suggests that the G-containing genotypes of rs4341 and rs4343 confer an additional risk of adverse COVID-19 prognosis. Thus, rs4341 and rs4343 polymorphisms of ACE could be predictive markers of severity of COVID-19 in those patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or diabetes. The knowledge of these genetic data could contribute to precision management of SARS-Cov2 infected patients when admitted to hospital."
[Behavioral disorders in children and adolescents with intellectual disability]./ Rasstroistva povedeniya u detei i podrostkov s umstvennoi otstalost'yu,"The relevance of the study of behavioral disorders in children and adolescents with intellectual disability is determined by the fact that the problem is at the intersection of different disciplines (psychiatry, psychology, pedagogics, sociology, criminology). Also, there are difficulties in analyzing the interaction between biological and social factors in etiology of such disorders. The review article discusses various aspects of behavioral disorders in children and adolescents with intellectual disability - the historical background, prevalence, etiology and pathogenesis, clinical picture. The authors point to the need for a new approach to the classification of behavioral disorders in intellectual disability."
Predicting health behavior in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Worldwide survey results from early March 2020,"The current pandemic outbreak of the novel COVID-19, which originated from Wuhan in China in late 2019, has eventually spread to six continents with a rising toll of death cases. No vaccine has yet been developed for COVID-19. The compliance of the general public with the advice and regulations of the health authorities and the adoption of effective health behavior regimens are currently the only weapons to effectively cope with the disease. Here we report the results of a worldwide survey (n = 953) conducted between March 2 and March 14, 2020 that sought (a) to identify critical proximal predictors of health behavior relevant to the current situation, (b) to examine their relationships to various demographic characteristics of the population, (c) and to provide a model of health behavior specific to COVID-19. We found that the perceived severity of the disease and susceptibility to it, emotional reactions, and attitudes toward COVID-19 predicted one-third of the preventive behavior variance. Various demographic variables influenced these predictors. Based on the data collected, we constructed, using path analysis, a theoretical model of health behavior. Our results emphasize the need to consider the impact of antecedent variables on actual precautionary behavior and the influence of demographic factors on these antecedent variables. Understanding the complex interplay of these precursors in health behavior will maximize their beneficial role, eliminate maladaptive prevention patterns, and facilitate the eradication of the disease."
A novel strategy to develop deep learning for image super-resolution using original ultra-high-resolution computed tomography images of lung as training dataset,"PURPOSE: To improve the image quality of inflated fixed cadaveric human lungs by utilizing ultra-high-resolution computed tomography (U-HRCT) as a training dataset for super-resolution processing using deep learning (SR-DL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Image data of nine cadaveric human lungs were acquired using U-HRCT. Three different matrix images of U-HRCT images were obtained with two acquisition modes: normal mode (512-matrix image) and super-high-resolution mode (1024- and 2048-matrix image). SR-DL used 512- and 1024-matrix images as training data for deep learning. The virtual 2048-matrix images were acquired by applying SR-DL to the 1024-matrix images. Three independent observers scored normal anatomical structures and abnormal computed tomography (CT) findings of both types of 2048-matrix images on a 3-point scale compared to 1024-matrix images. The image noise values were quantitatively calculated. Moreover, the edge rise distance (ERD) and edge rise slope (ERS) were also calculated using the CT attenuation profile to evaluate margin sharpness. RESULTS: The virtual 2048-matrix images significantly improved visualization of normal anatomical structures and abnormal CT findings, except for consolidation and nodules, compared with the conventional 2048-matrix images (p < 0.01). Quantitative noise values were significantly lower in the virtual 2048-matrix images than in the conventional 2048-matrix images (p < 0.001). ERD was significantly shorter in the virtual 2048-matrix images than in the conventional 2048-matrix images (p < 0.01). ERS was significantly higher in the virtual 2048-matrix images than in the conventional 2048-matrix images (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: SR-DL using original U-HRCT images as a training dataset might be a promising tool for image enhancement in terms of margin sharpness and image noise reduction. By applying trained SR-DL to U-HRCT SHR mode images, virtual ultra-high-resolution images were obtained which surpassed the image quality of unmodified SHR mode images."
Virtual Cancer Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: A Call for Evaluation,"The interplay of virtual care and cancer care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is unique and unprecedented. Patients with cancer are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and have worse outcomes than patients with COVID-19 who do not have cancer. Virtual care has been introduced quickly and extemporaneously in cancer treatment centers worldwide to maintain COVID-19–free zones. The outbreak of COVID-19 in a cancer center could have devastating consequences. The virtual care intervention that was first used in our cancer center, as well as many others, was a landline telephone in an office or clinic that connected a clinician with a patient. There is a lack of virtual care evaluation from the perspectives of patients and oncology health care providers. A number of factors for assessing oncology care delivered through a virtual care intervention have been described, including patient rapport, frailty, delicate conversations, team-based care, resident education, patient safety, technical effectiveness, privacy, operational effectiveness, and resource utilization. These factors are organized according to the National Quality Forum framework for the assessment of telehealth in oncology. This includes the following 4 domains of assessing outcomes: experience, access to care, effectiveness, and financial impact or cost. In terms of virtual care and oncology, the pandemic has opened the door to change. The lessons learned during the initial period of the pandemic have given rise to opportunities for the evolution of long-term virtual care. The opportunity to evaluate and improve virtual care should be seized upon."
JOBS Program Germany for health promotion among the unemployed in the community setting with institutions for employment promotion (JobsProgramDtl): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Compared to the employed, the unemployed are characterized by a substantially worse health status, particularly with regards to mental health. At the same time, conventional offers of prevention and health promotion rarely reach the unemployed. The JOBS Program is a health promotion program that combines job application training with elements of social learning theory and self-efficacy. Randomized field studies in the USA and Finland found significant positive effects on reintegration into the labor market and health amongst the unemployed. In this confirmatory study, we analyze whether the JOBS Program produces similar positive effects for the unemployed in Germany. METHODS: This study is designed as a country-wide, multi-center, non-blinded, two-armed, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial over 6 months. A total of approximately 1500 unemployed, who are willing to participate, are randomly assigned either to an intervention group or a waiting control group with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Guided by a team of two trainers, the intervention group completes JOBS Program Germany in small groups of 8 to 15 unemployed for a period of 1 week in units of 5 h a day. Primary outcome measures are the reintegration into the labor market, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, subjective state of health, depressive symptoms, and psychological distress. Of secondary interest are moderating variables such as socio-demographic characteristics, the duration of unemployment, and the job-search intensity. Outcomes will be repeatedly assessed via computer-assisted telephone interviews at three points in time: immediately before the intervention (pre-test), immediately after the intervention (post-test), and 6 months after the intervention has ended (6-months follow-up). DISCUSSION: This confirmatory study will provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the JOBS Program on the reintegration and (mental) health of the unemployed in Germany. If our results from the randomized controlled trail in a country-wide field experiment confirm its effectiveness, the JOBS Program Germany could, perspectively, be implemented into the German employment promotion and social security system on a long-term basis.

Diagnostic et traitement des viroses émergentes : comment aller de l’avant ?,"Virus emergence episodes follow one another at a steady pace. The medical and scientific community responds to needs as and when they arise but finds difficult to propose a global strategy in the medium and long term. Regarding diagnosis, priority should be given to anticipating the management of re-emerging pathogens, to developing capacities of real-time molecular diagnosis, and to preserving reference expertise and reference biological materials. This effort should also include sero-epidemiological studies aiming at obtaining a more accurate mapping of the circulation of potentially re-emerging pathogens. Regarding therapeutics (with the exception of vaccines which are addressed in another presentation), the expected improvements are the advance implementation of ready-to-use protocol frames for clinical trials and that of an ambitious strategy aiming at gradually covering the taxonomic spectrum of evolutionary virus groups infecting vertebrates."
Chronic primary pain in the COVID-19 pandemic: how uncertainty and stress impact on functioning and suffering.,
Addiction medicine in the time of COVID-19: An overview of the 2020 Joint Scientific Annual Conference of the International Society of Addiction Medicine and Canadian Society of Addiction Medicine,"For years, Substance Abuse has annually published a communication regarding the annual conference of the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM). These pieces have highlighted the important events of the conference and the work of the organization, as reflected in part by selected abstracts from the conference. This editorial communicates the events of the 2020 conference, the third to be held in conjunction with the Canadian Society of Addiction Medicine (CSAM) and the first virtual conference. The conference was attended by over 800 participants and covered a wide range of topics, including addiction medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges of not being able to meet physically in Victoria, British Columbia as had been planned, the virtual event provided an opportunity to share current information in order to help advance prevention, treatment, policy and public helath efforts relating to addressing addictions and helping those impacted by these often devastating conditions."
Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal in Measurably Evolving Populations,"Phylogenetic methods can use the sampling times of molecular sequence data to calibrate the molecular clock, enabling the estimation of evolutionary rates and timescales for rapidly evolving pathogens and data sets containing ancient DNA samples. A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time window, that is, whether the data can be treated as having come from a measurably evolving population. Here we investigate the performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS) in sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit to the data of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We conducted simulations under a wide range of conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not, even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore the behaviour of this classification in analyses of five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from Hepatitis B virus and mitochondrial genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an effective alternative to other tests of temporal signal. In particular, this method has the key advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the entire model, including the molecular clock and tree prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian phylodynamic analyses."
"Development and evaluation of an interprofessional student-led influenza vaccination clinic for medical, nursing and pharmacy students","BACKGROUND: Students in their final years of medicine, nursing and pharmacy degrees were invited to participate in an interprofessional influenza vaccination training course and clinic. Twenty-four students (8 from each discipline) were selected to participate. After vaccination training these students administered free influenza vaccines under supervision in two student-led clinics to 546 students in health and allied health programs prior to their clinical placements. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the students’ experience of the interprofessional vaccination training and clinic, and to evaluate the experiences of students who received their vaccination in the student-led clinic. METHODS: Before and after participating, students completed a questionnaire evaluating their perceived knowledge of influenza vaccinations, and their skills and confidence in administering vaccinations and the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). Eighteen students completed both the pre- and post-questionnaires. All students who received their flu vaccination were also asked to complete a short patient evaluation survey. RESULTS: The course resulted in significant increases in the students’ perceived knowledge of influenza vaccinations (27.5% increase, p<0.001), skills in managing patients receiving influenza vaccines (23.9% increase, p<0.001) and confidence level to administer influenza vaccines (46.0% increase, p<0.001). While there was no significant change in any subscales of the RIPLS, open-ended responses indicated that the students enjoyed and could see the benefits of meeting and learning with and from students from other health disciplines. Of the students who received their influenza vaccination, 97.7% were very likely or somewhat likely to recommend the clinic to fellow students. CONCLUSION: The interprofessional vaccination training and influenza vaccination clinic provided effective interprofessional vaccination training and afforded an authentic interprofessional experiential opportunity."
Giant Cell Arteritis as an Uncommon Cause of Chronic Cough: A Case Report,"Patient: Female, 27-year-old Final Diagnosis: Giant cell arteritis Symptoms: Cough Medication:— Clinical Procedure: — Specialty: Pulmonology OBJECTIVE: Unknown etiology BACKGROUND: Chronic cough is a common medical concern. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an uncommon cause of chronic cough and is not usually suspected since symptoms can be non-specific. We present a case of chronic cough due to GCA in which symptoms were subtle but imaging was remarkable and clearly disclosed the diagnosis. CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old woman presented to the pulmonary clinic with a concern of worsening cough for 4 months. She had been treated with proton pump inhibitor, intranasal steroids, and antibiotics, without improvement. Other symptoms were an occasional headache for the prior 5 months, but this had resolved. She had a history of early-stage breast and thyroid cancers, both of which were treated surgically several years earlier and were in remission. Results of a physical examination including flexible video laryngoscopy of the upper airway were completely normal. Laboratory investigations showed normal blood chemistries and blood cell counts. Her C-reactive protein level was 1 mg/L (upper limit of normal <10) but her erythrocyte sedimentation level was 121 mm/hr (upper limit of normal <30). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed as surveillance for her prior cancers. This showed diffuse tracer uptake in the aorta as well as bilateral common carotid, subclavian, and common iliac arteries, revealing GCA as the underlying diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Giant cell arteritis is a rare cause of chronic cough. Other symptoms can be subtle or non-specific as in our case, and a high index of suspicion is needed to obtain a temporal artery biopsy. In these cases, imaging adjuncts can provide a non-invasive diagnosis."
Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms with different latencies: a detailed clinicopathologic analysis.,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) arising in patients with prior cytotoxic treatments is considered a distinct entity due to its unfavorable prognosis. Latencies between the initial cytotoxic therapy and the occurrence of t-MNs vary but usually fall between 1 and 10 years. t-MNs with unusually short or long latencies are not well characterized. It is unclear if they are biologically similar to the ones with ordinary latencies and should be kept in the t-MN entity. We compiled a cohort of t-MN cases including short (<1 year), ordinary (1-10 years), and extended (>10 years) latencies from two tertiary medical centers. Both the t-MNs with ordinary and extended latencies showed high likelihood of high-risk genetic abnormalities and demonstrated no significant survival differences. But the t-MNs with extended latencies were more likely associated with history of multiple cancers (p = 0.007) and were younger at the time of cytotoxic treatments (p < 0.001) when compared to the t-MNs with ordinary latencies. The t-MN with short latencies appears to be a very rare and highly heterogeneous group. In summary, the genetic composition appears similar in the t-MNs with ordinary and extended latencies. However, the association between the t-MN with extended latencies and history of multiple cancers raises a possibility that cancer predisposition may contribute to the accumulation of genetic abnormalities in these patients. Investigation into potential germline mutations in the t-MN patients with extended latencies may provide important information for related family members."
Occurrence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in raw milk and feed from nine Chinese provinces and human exposure risk assessment.,"The per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are substantially produced and applied in industrial and domestic products, which have recently aroused great public concern for their potential toxicity to humans. In the present study, raw milk (n = 107) and cow feed samples (n = 70) were collected across nine Chinese provinces, in order to investigate the occurrence of PFASs in milk and feed, and the human exposure risk to milk. The concentrations of PFASs are in the range of < method detection limit -9.82 ng/g dw (average: 1.03 ng/g dw) for milk and 0.99-144 ng/g dw (7.68 ng/g dw) for feed. Perfluorobutanoic acid (34.0%) dominates in feed, while perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (67.5%) dominates in milk. No significant positive correlations of PFASs are observed between paired feed and milk (p > 0.05). However, feeds collected around fluorination production area show relatively higher PFAS levels than those from other areas, which also increase PFAS levels in milk. Risk assessment of PFASs through milk consumption is carried out according to evolving reference doses (RfDs). The hazard quotient is more than one for both adults and children when the strictest RfDs are applied. The Monte Carlo Simulation shows that children face higher PFAS exposure risk than adults."
A Simple Early Warning Signal for COVID-19,"The paper provides some initial evidence that daily mortality rates (for any cause) by municipality or province can be used as a statistically reliable predictor of looming COVID-19 crises. Using recently published deaths figures for 1,689 Italian municipalities, we estimate the growth in daily mortality rates between the period 2015-2019 and 2020 by province. All provinces that experienced a major COVID-19 shock in mid-March 2020 had increases in mortality rates of 100% or above already in early February 2020. This increase was particularly strong for males and older people, two recognizable features of COVID-19. Using a panel fixed effect model, we show that the association between these early increases in mortality for any cause and the March 2020 COVID-19 shock is strong and significant. We conclude that the growth in mortality rates can be used as a statistically reliable predictor of COVID-19 crises."
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oral health inequalities and access to oral healthcare in England,"While the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on health inequalities is documented, oral health has been absent from this discussion. This commentary highlights the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on oral health inequalities in England in February 2021. It includes a literature review, Public Health England and Kantar Worldpanel sales data on health behaviours and analysis of NHS dental services data. Purchasing data indicate, except for smoking, increases in health-compromising behaviours. Since the resumption of dental services, NHS general dental service use modestly recovered among adults but not children by October 2020. There are clear inequalities among children and older adults, with more deprived groups having lower uptake of dental service use than more affluent groups. Oral cancer referrals and hospital admissions for tooth extractions in children dramatically declined, with the latter primarily affecting children in more deprived areas. Many oral health programmes in schools and care homes were disrupted or suspended throughout this period. All these indicate that oral health inequalities have widened due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cohort profile: South Australian Aboriginal Birth Cohort (SAABC)—a prospective longitudinal birth cohort,"PURPOSE: The South Australian Aboriginal Birth Cohort (SAABC) is a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort established to: (1) estimate Aboriginal child dental disease compared with population estimates; (2) determine the efficacy of an early childhood caries intervention in early versus late infancy; (3) examine if efficacy was sustained over time and; (4) document factors influencing social, behavioural, cognitive, anthropometric, dietary and educational attainment over time. PARTICIPANTS: The original SAABC comprised 449 women pregnant with an Aboriginal child recruited February 2011 to May 2012. At child age 2 years, 324 (74%) participants were retained, at age 3 years, 324 (74%) participants were retained and at age 5 years, 299 (69%) participants were retained. Fieldwork for follow-up at age 7 years is underway, with funding available for follow-up at age 9 years. FINDINGS TO DATE: At baseline, 53% of mothers were aged 14–24 years and 72% had high school or less educational attainment. At age 3 years, dental disease experience was higher among children exposed to the intervention later rather than earlier in infancy. The effect was sustained at age 5 years, but rates were still higher than general child population estimates. Experiences of racism were high among mothers, with impacts on both tooth brushing and toothache. Compared with population estimates, levels of self-efficacy and self-rated oral health of mothers at baseline were low. FUTURE PLANS: Our data have contributed to a better understanding of the environmental, behavioural, dietary, biological and psychosocial factors contributing to Aboriginal child oral and general health, and social and emotional well-being. This is beneficial in charting the trajectory of cohort participants’ health and well-being overtime, particularly in identifying antecedents of chronic diseases which are highly prevalent among Aboriginal Australians. Funding for continued follow-up of the cohort will be sought. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12611000111976; Post-results."
Testing cardiovascular autonomic function in the COVID-19 era: lessons from Bologna’s Autonomic Unit,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the way most medical procedures are performed. Autonomic units, as well as other healthcare sectors, are required to undergo a thorough reorganization of the protocols in order to guarantee the safety of patients and healthcare staff. Cardiovascular autonomic function testing (CAFT) is necessary in certain situations; however, it poses several concerns which need to be addressed. Here, we provide some practical advice based on current national and international health authorities’ recommendations and our experience about how to perform CAFT during the COVID-19 emergency. We examine aspects regarding patients, healthcare staff, laboratory preparation, and test performance."
The use of chest ultrasonography in suspected cases of COVID-19 in the emergency department,"Aim: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) represents the diagnostic gold standard. We explored the value of chest ultrasonography to predict positivity to SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR in suspected COVID-19 cases. Patients & methods: Consecutive patients with suspect COVID-19 were included if they had fever and/or history of cough and/or dyspnea. Lung ultrasound score (LUSS) was computed according to published methods. Results: A total of 76 patients were included. A 3-variable model based on aspartate transaminase (AST) > upper limit of normal, LUSS >12 and body temperature >37.5°C yielded an overall accuracy of 91%. Conclusion: A simple LUSS-based model may represent a powerful tool for initial assessment in suspected cases of COVID-19."
Avidin-biotin complex-based capture coating platform for universal Influenza virus immobilization and characterization,"Influenza virus mutates quickly and unpredictably creating emerging pathogenic strains that are difficult to detect, diagnose, and characterize. Conventional tools to study and characterize virus, such as next generation sequencing, genome amplification (RT-PCR), and serological antibody testing, are not adequately suited to rapidly mutating pathogens like Influenza virus where the success of infection heavily depends on the phenotypic expression of surface glycoproteins. Bridging the gap between genome and pathogenic expression remains a challenge. Using sialic acid as a universal Influenza virus binding receptor, a novel virus avidin-biotin complex-based capture coating was developed and characterized that may be used to create future diagnostic and interrogation platforms for viable whole Influenza virus. First, fluorescent FITC probe studies were used to optimize coating component concentrations. Then atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to profile the surface characteristics of the novel capture coating, acquire topographical imaging of Influenza particles immobilized by the coating, and calculate the capture efficiency of the coating (over 90%) for all four representative human Influenza virus strains tested."
"From National Biosecurity Measures to Territorial ASF Preparedness: The Case of Free-Range Pig Farming in Corsica, France","In response to African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks in wild boars in Belgium in 2018, the French authorities issued national biosecurity measures for all pig farms, regardless of their geographical and socio-technical scale. Considering the Corsican pig farmers' demonstrations against these measures (for geographical, cultural, and economic reasons), this article questions the suitability of standardized top-down national measures that potentially endanger traditional breeding systems, which are increasingly marginalized in relation to the dominant industrial model. From an action-research approach, the article analyzes how local stakeholders go beyond usual classical biosecurity issues to propose a territorialized preparedness. Mediating between Corsican farmers and the government representatives, a technical committee made up of actors from various regional research and development bodies drew up a socially acceptable preparedness proposal. Viewing the health risk from a local standpoint, the committee provided arguments for maintaining the extensive grazing that is non-negotiable for the farmers, while getting the farmers to agree to change other practices (reproduction control) as a measure against health hazards already present. Analysis of the preparedness process and the mediation process shows that a territorialized bottom-up approach to the governance of health risks can make biosecurity measures more acceptable to farmers. It also points to the legitimacy of a set of alternatives to top-down measures that standardize farming systems and may lead to the disappearance of small farmers and their traditional systems."
Effects of Dietary Ferulic Acid Supplementation on Hepatic Injuries in Tianfu Broilers Challenged with Lipopolysaccharide,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an endotoxin that can cause an imbalance between the oxidation and antioxidant defense systems and then induces hepatic damages. Ferulic acid (FA) has multiple biological functions including antibacterial and antioxidant activities; however, the effect of FA on lipopolysaccharide-induced hepatic injury remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of dietary Ferulic acid against Lipopolysaccharide-induced hepatic injuries in Tianfu broiler chickens. The results showed that supplementation of FA in daily feed increased body weight (BW) and decreased the feed conversion ratio (FCR) in LPS treatment broilers significantly (p < 0.05). Additionally, supplement of FA alleviated histological changes and apoptosis of hepatocytes in LPS treatment broilers. Supplement of FA significantly decreases the activities of ROS. Interestingly, the levels of antioxidant parameters including total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and glutathione (GSH) in LPS group were significantly increased by the FA supplementation (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, administration of LPS to broilers decreased the expressions of Nrf2, NQO1, SOD, GSH-Px, CAT and Bcl-2, whereas it increased the expressions of Bax and Caspase-3 (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expressions of Nrf2, NQO1, SOD, CAT, Bcl-2 were significantly upregulated and Caspase-3 were significantly downregulated in the FL group when compared to LPS group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation of FA in daily feed improves growth performance and alleviates LPS-induced oxidative stress, histopathologic changes, and apoptosis of hepatocytes in Tianfu broilers."
"Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS): Italian adaptation, psychometrics and diagnostics","BACKGROUND: Telephone-based cognitive screening (TBCS) is crucial to telehealth care of neurological patients, prevention campaigns, and epidemiological studies on cognitive impairment. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) is one of the most widespread and psychometrically/diagnostically sound TBCS test, with several versions developed worldwide (e.g., with and without a delayed recall item). In Italy, only attempts of adaptation and preliminary evidence of its statistical features have been provided so far. This study thus aimed at (1) developing an Italian version of the TICS and assessing its (2) psychometric and (3) diagnostic properties. METHODS: A back-translated and culturally adapted version of the TICS was developed. Three-hundred and sixty-five healthy individuals from different regions of Italy (147 males, 216 females; age: 53.2 ± 16 years; education: 13 ± 4.5 years) were administered the TICS and the Italian telephone-based Mini-Mental State Examination (Itel-MMSE). Validity was tested by convergence and at the structure level, whereas reliability as internal consistency, test–retest, and inter-rater. Diagnostic accuracy, item difficulty, and discrimination were also examined. RESULTS: The TICS featured a single component and its score converged with that of the Itel-MMSE (r(s) = .37). Reliability was excellent as inter-rater (ICC = .94), good as test–retest (ICC = .78), and acceptable as internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .63). Accuracy was high as tested against the Itel-MMSE (AUC = .83) and did not improve when adding the delayed recall. Backward subtraction was the most difficult and discriminative task. DISCUSSION: The Italian TICS is a valid, reliable, and diagnostically accurate TBCS test. The original format of the TICS can be thus adopted in both clinical and research settings. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10072-021-05729-7."
"COVID-19, Antiphospholipid Antibodies, and Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome: A Possible Association?","Since the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019, research on the complications and fatality of this virus has hastened. Initially, case reports drew an association between COVID-19 and abnormal coagulation parameters. Subsequently, cross-sectional studies found a high prevalence of thrombosis among ICU and non-ICU COVID-19 patients. For that reason, certain studies tried to explain the pathogenic mechanisms of thrombosis, one of which was the emergence of anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL). Although aPL have been found positive in very few patients, their association with thrombotic events stays debatable. Given the thrombotic manifestations of COVID-19 and the potential role of aPL, the catastrophic form of APS (CAPS) might be a major fatal phenomenon. However, to date, there has been no clear association of CAPS to COVID-19. Moreover, since infections, including viral respiratory similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are considered main etiologies for CAPS, it could be possible that SARS-CoV-2 can induce CAPS although no evidence is currently found. High quality studies are needed to develop a clear idea on the pathogenic role of aPL in the progression of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients, and how such patients could be fit into a thromboprophylaxis plan."
A DRY COUGH CONUNDRUM: A RARE CASE OF PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECII PNEUMONIA IN SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOUS PATIENT ON HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE,
Targeted Therapeutic Strategies for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, which is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression and the absence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression/amplification. Conventional chemotherapy is the mainstay of systemic treatment for TNBC. However, lack of molecular targeted therapies and poor prognosis of TNBC patients have prompted a great effort to discover effective targets for improving the clinical outcomes. For now, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi’s) and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of TNBC. Moreover, agents that target signal transduction, angiogenesis, epigenetic modifications, and cell cycle are under active preclinical or clinical investigations. In this review, we highlight the current major developments in targeted therapies of TNBC, with some descriptions about their (dis)advantages and future perspectives."
A novel model to manage air cargo disruptions caused by global catastrophes such as Covid-19,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically disrupted the air cargo industry. This disruption has taken many directions, one of which is the demand imbalance which occurs due to the sudden change in the cargo capacity, as well as demand. Therefore, the random change leads to excessive demand in some routes (hot-selling routes), while some other routes suffer from a big shortage of demand (underutilized routes). Routes are substitutable when there are several adjacent airports in the Origin & Destination (O&D) market. In this market, demand imbalance between substitutable routes occurs because of the above reasons. To tackle the demand imbalance problem, a novel model is introduced to estimate the quantity combinations which maintains the balance between underutilized and hot-selling routes. This model is a variant of the classic Cournot model which captures different quantity scenarios in the form of the best response for each route compared to the other. We then cultivate the model by integrating the Puppet Cournot game with the quantity discount policy. The quantity discount policy is an incentive which motivates the freight forwarders to increase their orders in the underutilized routes. After conducting numerical experiments, the results reveal that the profit can increase up to 25% by using the quantity discount. However, the quantity discount model is only applicable when the profit increase in the hot-selling route is greater than the profit decrease in the underutilized route."
Receptor-Binding Domain Proteins of SARS-CoV-2 Variants Elicited Robust Antibody Responses Cross-Reacting with Wild-Type and Mutant Viruses in Mice,"Multiple variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have spread around the world, but the neutralizing effects of antibodies induced by the existing vaccines have declined, which highlights the importance of developing vaccines against mutant virus strains. In this study, nine receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 lineages) were constructed and fused with the Fc fragment of human IgG (RBD-Fc). These RBD-Fc proteins contained single or multiple amino acid substitutions at prevalent mutation points of spike protein, which enabled them to bind strongly to the polyclonal antibodies specific for wild-type RBD and to the recombinant human ACE2 protein. In the BALB/c, mice were immunized with the wild-type RBD-Fc protein first and boosted twice with the indicated mutant RBD-Fc proteins later. All mutant RBD-Fc proteins elicited high-level IgG antibodies and cross-neutralizing antibodies. The RBD-Fc proteins with multiple substitutions tended to induce higher antibody titers and neutralizing-antibody titers than the single-mutant RBD-Fc proteins. Meanwhile, both wild-type RBD-Fc protein and mutant RBD-Fc proteins induced significantly decreased neutralization capacity to the pseudovirus of B.1.351 and P.1 lineages than to the wild-type one. These data will facilitate the design and development of RBD-based subunit vaccines against SARS-COV-2 and its variants."
Scarlett Letter: A study based on experience of stigma by COVID-19 patients in quarantine,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stigma around COVID-19 is a major barrier in global efforts to control the COVID 19 pandemic. Limited data is available regarding stigma faced by COVID-19 patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The aim of the current study was to explore the stigma experienced by hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness in Lahore, Pakistan. METHODS: Following Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, patients were assessed using modified HIV short form stigma scale and open-ended questions. Questions focused on experiences, feelings, and opinions as to how patients feel and how they were treated prior to and during the hospitalization. Data analysis for quantitative data was performed using SPSS-20, while qualitative responses were interpreted by content analysis method. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen patients were interviewed (Mean age 38.8 years + 15.3) with 53.5% being males. Widespread experience of stigma was reported by patients particularly for concerns about public attitudes (7.43 + 1.43) & disclosure (6.89 + 1.45). Main themes which emerged from the qualitative responses were social stigma and rejection, humiliating behaviour of others, breach of confidentiality, loss of trust/ respect, and impact of COVID-19 diagnosis on their business. CONCLUSIONS: Existence of significant stigma among COVID-19 patients isolated in a tertiary care hospital in a LMIC highlights the need for culturally sensitive strategies to address it."
SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary schools in northern France: A retrospective cohort study in an area of high transmission,"Background: The extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among pupils in primary schools and their families is unknown. Methods: Between 28-30 April 2020, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among pupils, their parents and relatives, and staff of primary schools exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 in a city north of Paris, France. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered sociodemographic information and history of recent symptoms. A blood sample was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a flow-cytometry-based assay. Results: The infection attack rate (IAR) was 45/510 (8.8%), 3/42 (7.1%), 1/28 (3.6%), 76/641 (11.9%) and 14/119 (11.8%) among primary school pupils, teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, and relatives, respectively (P = 0.29). Prior to school closure on February 14, three SARS-CoV-2 infected pupils attended three separate schools with no secondary cases in the following 14 days among pupils, teachers and non-teaching staff of the same schools. Familial clustering of cases was documented by the high proportion of antibodies among parents and relatives of infected pupils (36/59 = 61.0% and 4/9 = 44.4%, respectively). In children, disease manifestations were mild, and 24/58 (41.4%) of infected children were asymptomatic. Interpretation: In young children, SARS-CoV-2 infection was largely mild or asymptomatic and there was no evidence of onwards transmission from children in the school setting."
Success of Big Infectious Disease Reimbursement Policy in China,"Big infectious diseases do harm to the whole society, and it is highly crucial to control them on time. The major purpose of this article is to theoretically demonstrate that the Chinese government’s intervention in large-scale infectious diseases is successful and efficient. Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was infectious disease without government intervention, and strategy 2 was infectious disease with government intervention. By evolution model, this article illustrates the efficiency of big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. Without government reimbursement, this article finds that high expenditures accelerate the disease infection. The number of infected persons decreases under big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. The higher the treatment costs, the more important the government intervention. Big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China can serve as an efficient example to cope with big infectious diseases."

Dendritic Cell-Specific Antigen Delivery by Coronavirus Vaccine Vectors Induces Long-Lasting Protective Antiviral and Antitumor Immunity,"Efficient vaccination against infectious agents and tumors depends on specific antigen targeting to dendritic cells (DCs). We report here that biosafe coronavirus-based vaccine vectors facilitate delivery of multiple antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines to professional antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo. Vaccine vectors based on heavily attenuated murine coronavirus genomes were generated to express epitopes from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein, or human Melan-A, in combination with the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These vectors selectively targeted DCs in vitro and in vivo resulting in vector-mediated antigen expression and efficient maturation of DCs. Single application of only low vector doses elicited strong and long-lasting cytotoxic T-cell responses, providing protective antiviral and antitumor immunity. Furthermore, human DCs transduced with Melan-A-recombinant human coronavirus 229E efficiently activated tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. Taken together, this novel vaccine platform is well suited to deliver antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines to DCs and to initiate and maintain protective immunity."

"Real-world clinical performance of commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests in suspected COVID-19: A systematic meta-analysis of available data as per November 20, 2020","Background: Immunochromatographic rapid antigen tests (RATs) emerged onto the COVID-19 pandemic testing landscape to aid in the rapid diagnosis of people with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RATs are particularly useful where RT-PCR is not immediately available and symptoms suggestive of a high viral load and infectiousness are assumed. Several lateral flow immunoassays have been authorized for use under EUA and/or the CE mark, presenting varying overall clinical performance data generated by the manufacturer or by independent investigators. To compare the real-world clinical performance of commercially available rapid chromatographic immunoassays intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of published data. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE (R), Embase, BIOSIS and Derwent Drug File (ProQuest) for manufacturer-independent prospective clinical performance studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 RATs and RT-PCR assays. Only studies on lateral flow assays not needing a separate reader for retrieving the result were included, if data were available on viral load, patients' symptom status, sample type, and PCR assay used. For better data comparability, recalculation of the studies' single performance data confidence intervals using the exact Clopper-Pearson method was applied. Results: We could include 19 studies (ten peer-reviewed) presenting detailed clinical performance data on 11,209 samples with 2449 RT-PCR-positives out of study prevalence rates between 1.9-100% and between 50-100% symptomatic samples. Four studies directly compared two to three different RATs and 15 studies compared one RAT to RT-PCR. Overall specificity ranged, with one test outlier, between 92.4% (87.4-95.9) and 100% (99.7-100), and overall clinical sensitivity varied between 28.9% (16.4-44.3) and 98.3% (91.1-99.7), depending on assay, population characteristics, viral load, and symptom status. Sensitivity in high-viral-load samples (cycle threshold [≤]25) showed a considerable heterogeneity among the assays ranging from 66.7% to 100%. Conclusion: Only two RATs offered sufficient manufacturer-independent, real-world performance data supporting use for the detection of current SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic or high-viral-load patient populations. Reliable positive predictive values require testing of symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals only in case of a high pre-test probability. If RATs are used for screening of asymptomatic cases in low-prevalence scenarios, a lower positive predictive value of the result has to be considered."
Reaktionsmuster der lokoregionären Lymphknoten im Abflussgebiet von COVID-19-Lungen,"BACKGROUND: A dysregulated immune response is considered one of the major factors leading to severe COVID-19. Previously described mechanisms include the development of a cytokine storm, missing immunoglobulin class switch, antibody-mediated enhancement, and aberrant antigen presentation. OBJECTIVES: To understand the heterogeneity of immune response in COVID-19, a thorough investigation of histomorphological patterns in regional lymph nodes was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymph nodes from the cervical, mediastinal, and hilar regions were extracted from autopsies of patients with lethal COVID-19 (n = 20). Histomorphological characteristics, SARS-CoV‑2 qRT-PCR, and gene expression profiling on common genes involved in immunologic response were analyzed. RESULTS: Lymph nodes displayed moderate to severe capillary stasis and edema, an increased presence of extrafollicular plasmablasts, mild to moderate plasmacytosis, a dominant population of CD8(+) T‑cells, and CD11c/CD68(+) histiocytosis with hemophagocytic activity. Out of 20 cases, 18 presented with hypoplastic or missing germinal centers with a decrease of follicular dendritic cells and follicular T‑helper cells. A positive viral load was detected by qRT-PCR in 14 of 20 cases, yet immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen revealed positivity in sinus histiocytes of only one case. Gene expression analysis revealed an increased expression of STAT1, CD163, granzyme B, CD8A, MZB1, and PAK1, as well as CXCL9. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings imply a dysregulated immune response in lethal COVID-19. The absence/hypoplasia of germinal centers and increased presence of plasmablasts implies a transient B‑cell response, implying an impaired development of long-term immunity against SARS-CoV‑2 in such occasions."
Estimating Vehicle and Pedestrian Activity from Town and City Traffic Cameras †,"Traffic cameras are a widely available source of open data that offer tremendous value to public authorities by providing real-time statistics to understand and monitor the activity levels of local populations and their responses to policy interventions such as those seen during the COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This paper presents an end-to-end solution based on the Google Cloud Platform with scalable processing capability to deal with large volumes of traffic camera data across the UK in a cost-efficient manner. It describes a deep learning pipeline to detect pedestrians and vehicles and to generate mobility statistics from these. It includes novel methods for data cleaning and post-processing using a Structure SImilarity Measure (SSIM)-based static mask that improves reliability and accuracy in classifying people and vehicles from traffic camera images. The solution resulted in statistics describing trends in the ‘busyness’ of various towns and cities in the UK. We validated time series against Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras across North East England, showing a close correlation between our statistical output and the ANPR source. Trends were also favorably compared against traffic flow statistics from the UK’s Department of Transport. The results of this work have been adopted as an experimental faster indicator of the impact of COVID-19 on the UK economy and society by the Office for National Statistics (ONS)."
COINFECÇÃO COVID-19 E MALÁRIA: UM RELATO DE CASO,"Introdução Febre e cefaleia são comuns em várias doenças infectocontagiosas, entre elas a malária, que segue sendo um problema de saúde pública no mundo. É possível que a linfopenia observada em pacientes com COVID-19 possa aumentar a vulnerabilidade à malária e a outras infecções. Relata-se, então, caso de paciente com coinfecção COVID-19 e malária. Homem de 40 anos previamente hígido apresentou cefaleia, mialgia e febre, sem tosse ou dispneia. Retornou há 18 dias de área rural do Estado de Mato Grosso. Apresentou piora da cefaleia 8 dias após, procurando atendimento. Iniciou febre de 38,7°C, 10 episódios de vômitos. mas estado geral era regular, estava hipocorado, desidratado, ictérico, FC 95 bpm, PA 145 × 90 mmHg, SpO2 95% em ar ambiente, FR 25 rpm, sem alterações respiratórias. Após as hipóteses de malária e COVID-19, visualizaram-se formas irregulares de Plamodium vivax no sangue periférico, RT-PCR para SARS-CoV-2 foi detectado no cycle threshold (Ct) 36, Hb 11,6 g/dL, Ht 36%, leucócitos 4.770/μl, plaquetas 39.100/μl, DHL 291 U/L, bilirrubina total de 6,68mg/dL (direta 4,76), Dímero D 4.240ng/mL, ferritina 1.141 ng/mL. TC de tórax evidenciou opacidades em vidro fosco e raras consolidações, esparsas e bilaterais, com distribuição predominantemente peribroncovascular com atelectasias laminares bilaterais, notadamente nos campos pulmonares superiores. Iniciado tratamento com primaquina e cloroquina e, no 2° dia de internação, evoluiu com dispneia e dessaturação, sendo iniciado cateter nasal de baixo fluxo a 3L/min. Pesquisa de hematozoários de controle foi negativa. Houve melhora gradual, recebendo alta. Comentários História clinico-epidemiológica detalhada é necessária para um diagnóstico correto e criar lógica para um plano de tratamento, principalmente, levando em consideração outras doenças contagiosas endêmicas em países tropicais. A Organização Mundial de Saúde OMS está monitorando a evolução da COVID-19 e precisa aconselhar os países com regiões endêmicas de malária na execução de políticas públicas de saúde. A alocação de recursos deve ser otimizada, sempre que possível, para garantir uma interrupção mínima no controle da malária, caso o gerenciamento da COVID-19 seja necessário."
Identification of Immunohistochemical Reagents for In Situ Protein Expression Analysis of Coronavirus-associated Changes in Human Tissues,"We studied the suitability of commercially available monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in standard archival specimens. Antibodies were screened on HEK293 cells transfected with viral nucleoprotein, S1 subunit and S2 subunit of spike protein and on untransfected cells, as well as a panel of normal tissue. Lung tissue with presence of SARS-CoV2 confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) was also used. A total of 7 mAbs were tested: (1) mAb 001 (Sino Biological, 40143-R001), (2) mAb 007 (Sino Biological, 40150-R007), (3) mAb 019 (Sino Biological, 40143-R019), (4) mAb 1A9 (GeneTex, GTX632604), (5) mAb ABM19C9 (Abeomics, 10-10007), (6) FIPV3-70 (Santa Cruz, SC-65653), and (7) mAb 6F10 (BioVision, A2060). Only 2 mAbs, clone 001 to the nucleoprotein and clone 1A9 to the S2 subunit spike protein displayed specific immunoreactivity. Both clones showed strong staining in the acute phase of COVID-19 pneumonia, mostly in areas of acute diffuse alveolar damage, but were not completely congruent. Viral protein was also found in kidney tubules, endothelia of multiple organs and a nasal swab of a patient with persistent SARS-CoV2 infection. The other tested reagents were either poorly reactive or demonstrated nonspecific staining in tissues and lesions not infected by SARS-CoV2. Our study demonstrates that rigid specificity testing is mandatory for the evaluation of mAbs to SARS-CoV2 and that clones 001 to nucleoprotein and 1A9 to S2 subunit spike protein are useful for the in situ detection of SARS-CoV2."

"Lycorine, a non-nucleoside RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, as potential treatment for emerging coronavirus infections","Background: Highly effective novel treatments need to be developed to suppress emerging coronavirus (CoV) infections such as COVID-19. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) among the viral proteins is known as an effective antiviral target. Lycorine is a phenanthridine Amaryllidaceae alkaloid isolated from the bulbs of Lycoris radiata (L'Hér.) Herb. and has various pharmacological bioactivities including antiviral function. Purpose: We investigated the direct-inhibiting action of lycorine on CoV's RdRp, as potential treatment for emerging CoV infections. Methods: We examined the inhibitory effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, and then quantitatively measured the inhibitory effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV RdRp activity using a cell-based reporter assay. Finally, we performed the docking simulation with lycorine and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Results: Lycorine efficiently inhibited these CoVs with IC(50) values of 2.123±0.053, 1.021±0.025, and 0.878±0.022 μM, respectively, comparable with anti-CoV effects of remdesivir. Lycorine directly inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity with an IC(50) of 1.406 ± 0.260 μM, compared with remdesivir's IC(50) value of 6.335 ± 0.731 μM. In addition, docking simulation showed that lycorine interacts with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp at the Asp623, Asn691, and Ser759 residues through hydrogen bonding, at which the binding affinities of lycorine (−6.2 kcal/mol) were higher than those of remdesivir (−4.7 kcal/mol). Conclusions: Lycorine is a potent non-nucleoside direct-acting antiviral against emerging coronavirus infections and acts by inhibiting viral RdRp activity; therefore, lycorine may be a candidate against the current COVID-19 pandemic."
Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellow Training in North America,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed healthcare systems and training around the world. The Training Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition sought to understand how COVID-19 has affected pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training. METHODS: A 21 question survey was distributed to all 77 pediatric gastroenterology fellowship program directors (PDs) in the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition program director database via email on April 7. Responses collected through April 19, 2020 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-one of 77 (66%) PDs from the United States, Canada, and Mexico responded to the survey. Forty-six of 51 (90%) PDs reported that they were under a “stay-at-home” order for a median of 4 weeks at the time of the survey. Two of the 51 (4%) programs had fellows participating in outpatient telehealth before COVID-19 and 39 of 51 (76%) at the time of the survey. Fellows stopped participating in outpatient clinics in 22 of 51 (43%) programs and endoscopy in 26 of 51 (52%) programs. Changes to inpatient care included reduced fellow staffing, limiting who entered patient rooms, and rounding remotely. Fellows in 3 New York programs were deployed to adult medicine units. Didactics were moved to virtual conferences in 47 of 51 (94%) programs, and fellows used various online resources. Clinical research and, disproportionately, bench research were restricted. CONCLUSIONS: This report provides early information of the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric fellowship training. Rapid adoption of telehealth and reduced clinical and research experiences were important changes. Survey information may spur communication and innovation to help educators adapt."
The Implementation of DNA Methylation Profiling into a Multistep Diagnostic Process in Pediatric Neuropathology: A 2-Year Real-World Experience by the French Neuropathology Network,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Supported by the “easy-to-use” and free DKFZ central nervous system (CNS) tumor classification web tool, DNA methylation profiling is a method changing the routine diagnostic practice in neuro-oncology. This work depicts a real-world practice experience by the French neuropathology network of incorporating DNA methylation profiling into the diagnostic process of challenging pediatric CNS tumors. After two rounds of histopathological review by neuropathology experts—including morphology, neuroimaging, immunohistochemistry, panel sequencing and FISH—62 tumors still presenting diagnostic uncertainty were selected for DNA methylation profiling. Using the DKFZ “classifier” and combining all additional information obtained from DNA methylation array, we observed significant diagnostic refinements and amendments. DNA methylation was successful in a significant number of cases (71%) despite the complex specificities of the cohort. Our study evaluates how DNA methylation testing would impact diagnosis and presents illustrative and representative cases. ABSTRACT: DNA methylation profiling has recently emerged as a powerful tool to help establish diagnosis in neuro-oncology. Here we present our national diagnostic strategy as the French neuropathology network (RENOCLIP-LOC) and our current approach of integrating DNA methylation profiling into our multistep diagnostic process for challenging pediatric CNS tumors. The tumors with diagnostic uncertainty were prospectively selected for DNA methylation after two rounds of review by neuropathology experts. We first integrated the classifier score into the histopathological findings. Subsequent analyses using t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) representation were performed. An additional step consisted of analyzing copy-number variation data (CNV). Finally, we combined all data to establish diagnoses and evaluated the impact of DNA methylation profiling on diagnostic and grading changes that would affect patient management. Over two years, 62 pediatric tumors were profiled. (1) Integrating the classifier score to the histopathological findings impacted the diagnosis in 33 cases (53%). (2) t-SNE analysis provided arguments for diagnosis in 26/35 cases with calibrated scores <0.84 (74.3%). (3) CNV investigations also evidenced alterations used for diagnosis and prognostication. (4) A diagnosis was finally established for 44 tumors (71%). Our results support the use of DNA methylation for challenging pediatric tumors. We demonstrated how additional methylation-based analyses complement the classifier score to support conventional histopathological diagnosis."
Treating the Host Response to Ebola Virus Disease with Generic Statins and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers,"Treatments targeting the Ebola virus may eventually be shown to work, but they will not have an impact on overall Ebola mortality in West Africa. Endothelial dysfunction is responsible for the fluid and electrolyte imbalances seen in Ebola patients. Because inexpensive generic statins and angiotensin receptor blockers restore endothelial barrier integrity, they can be used to treat the host response in these patients. In Sierra Leone, approximately 100 Ebola patients were treated with this combination, and reports indicate that survival was greatly improved."
Human challenge trials to assess the efficacy of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants,
A systematic review of telehealth applications in hospital medicine.,"BACKGROUND Despite the proliferation of telehealth, uptake for acute inpatient services has been slower. Hospitalist shortages in rural and critical access hospitals as well as the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a renewed interest in telehealth to deliver acute inpatient services. Understanding current evidence is crucial for promoting uptake and developing evidence-based practices. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review of telehealth applications in acute inpatient general medicine and pediatric hospital wards and synthesize available evidence. DATA SOURCES A search of five databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and ProQuest Theses, and Dissertations) using a combination of search terms including telemedicine and hospital medicine/inpatient care keywords yielded 17,015 citations. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Two independent coders determined eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted and organized into main categories based on findings: (1) feasibility and planning, (2) implementation and technology, and (3) telehealth application process and outcome measures. RESULTS Of the 20 publications included, three were feasibility and planning studies describing the creation of the program, services provided, and potential cost implications. Five studies described implementation and technology used, including training, education, and evaluation methods. Finally, twelve discussed process and outcome measures, including patient and provider satisfaction and costs. CONCLUSION Telehealth services for hospital medicine were found to be effective, well received, and initial cost estimates appear favorable. A variety of services were described across programs with considerable benefit appreciated by rural and smaller hospitals. Additional work is needed to evaluate clinical outcomes and overall program costs."
Adolescents’ experiences of the information they received about the coronavirus (Covid-19) in Norway: a cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: In the first months of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, many countries took radical prevention measures. Authorities had to communicate with the public regularly to explain and ensure compliance with these measures and promote safety. The information given by authorities was mainly developed for adults, but children and adolescents may have different needs when it comes to information. This study examined how adolescents perceived information about Covid-19 provided by the media and other sources, and about what topics adolescents reported they lacked information during the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three hundred seventy-seven adolescents in 11th, 12th, and 13th grade in Norwegian upper secondary schools (67% girls) completed an online questionnaire. Analyses included descriptive statistics, in addition to Generalized Linear Mixed Models analyses to examine gender differences in adolescents’ satisfaction with the information provided about Covid-19, to what extent the pandemic affected their everyday life, and to what extent they were concerned about becoming infected with Covid-19. RESULTS: The results showed that the majority of adolescents used the internet as the main source of information about Covid-19, followed by (online) newspapers. About half (49%) reported that they were satisfied with the information available, while 39% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 12% were dissatisfied. Adolescents wanted more information about the school situation, as well as virus- and future-related topics. A total of 21% reported that they were concerned about becoming infected with Covid-19. There was no significant gender difference in overall satisfaction with the information provided about Covid-19. Girls reported being significantly more affected by the pandemic than boys, and that they were significantly more concerned than boys about becoming infected with Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: This survey provides important knowledge to professionals working with adolescents, as well as to authorities, about what information channels can be used to reach adolescents, and what information they lacked about the Covid-19 pandemic."
Complete abolishment of coagulant activity in monomeric disulfide-deficient tissue factor,
Analysing recovery from pandemics by Learning Theory: the case of CoVid-19,"We present a method for predicting the recovery time from infectious diseases outbreaks such as the recent CoVid-19 virus. The approach is based on the theory of learning from errors, specifically adapted to the control of the virus spread by reducing infection rates using countermeasures such as medical treatment, isolation, social distancing etc. When these are effective, the infection rate, after reaching a peak, declines following a given recovery rate curve. We use presently available data from China, South Korea and others to make actual predictions of the time needed for securing minimum infection rates in the future."
Toxicological analysis of George’s marvellous medicine: literature review,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the therapeutic effects and toxicity of the eponymous concoction described in Roald Dahl’s book George’s Marvellous Medicine. DESIGN: Literature review. SETTING: Two literature loving households in England. PARTICIPANTS: George Kranky and grandma Kranky. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and toxic effects of the individual ingredients checked against those listed in ToxBase, the National Poisons Information Service’s poisons database. RESULTS: The medicine contained 34 ingredients. The most common toxic effect identified on ToxBase was nausea and vomiting (16 ingredients, 47%). Potentially life threatening effects were associated with 13 (38%) ingredients, including depression of the central nervous system, kidney injury, convulsions, cardiac toxicity, and mucosal erosion. The effects described in the book were accurate initially but then diverted from the most likely clinical outcome (death). CONCLUSIONS: Although Dahl ought to be applauded for his initial accuracy about the toxicology of the ingredients in George’s marvellous medicine, the overall effect would be fatal catastrophic physiological collapse. Scientific exploration and experimentation should be encouraged in children, although any medicinal ingredients need to be checked for potential toxicity before being administered—to grandmas or anyone else."
"High influenza A prevalence but no SARS-CoV-2 among 2021 Grand Magal pilgrims in Touba, Senegal",
Antiviral activity of silymarin against chikungunya virus,"The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes chikungunya fever, with clinical presentations such as severe back and small joint pain, and debilitating arthritis associated with crippling pains that persist for weeks and even years. Although there are several studies to evaluate the efficacy of drugs against CHIKV, the treatment for chikungunya fever is mainly symptom-based and no effective licensed vaccine or antiviral are available. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of three types of flavonoids against CHIKV in vitro replication. Three compounds: silymarin, quercetin and kaempferol were evaluated for their in vitro antiviral activities against CHIKV using a CHIKV replicon cell line and clinical isolate of CHIKV of Central/East African genotype. A cytopathic effect inhibition assay was used to determine their activities on CHIKV viral replication and quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to calculate virus yield. Antiviral activity of effective compound was further investigated by evaluation of CHIKV protein expression using western blotting for CHIKV nsP1, nsP3, and E2E1 proteins. Briefly, silymarin exhibited significant antiviral activity against CHIKV, reducing both CHIKV replication efficiency and down-regulating production of viral proteins involved in replication. This study may have important consequence for broaden the chance of getting the effective antiviral for CHIKV infection."
Molecular epidemiology of canine parvovirus type 2 in Vietnam from November 2016 to February 2018,"BACKGROUND: Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) was first identified in the late 1970s; it causes intestinal hemorrhage with severe bloody diarrhea in kennels and dog shelters worldwide. Since its emergence, CPV-2 has been replaced with new genetic variants (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c). Currently, information about the genotype prevalence of CPV-2 in Vietnam is limited. In the present study, we investigated the genotype prevalence and distribution of CPV-2 in the three regions of Vietnam. METHODS: Rectal swabs were collected from 260 dogs with suspected CPV-2 infection from northern, central, and southern Vietnam from November 2016 to February 2018. All samples were identified as parvovirus positive by real-time PCR, and further genotyping was performed using a SimpleProbe® real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of the 260 Vietnamese CPV-2 isolates, 6 isolates (2.31%) were identified as CPV-2a, 251 isolates (96.54%) were identified as CPV-2c and 3 isolates (1.15%) were untypable using the SimpleProbe® real-time PCR assay. In northern Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 2.97% (3/101) and 97.3% (98/101), respectively. In central Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 1.11% (1/90) and 98.89% (89/90), respectively. In southern Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 3.03% (2/66) and 96.97% (64/66), respectively. CPV-2b was not observed in this study. The VP2 genes of CPV-2c in Vietnam are more genetically similar to those of CPV-2c strains in China and Taiwan than to those of prototype CPV-2c strains (FJ222821) or the first Vietnamese CPV-2c (AB120727). CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that CPV-2c is the most prevalent variant in Vietnam. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the recent Vietnamese CPV-2c isolates share a common evolutionary origin with Asian CPV-2c strains.

Remote consultations for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa during the COVID‐19 pandemic: a single‐centre experience,"Remote dermatology consultations largely superseded face‐to‐face (FTF) consultations during the peak of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the UK. Remote examination of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) brings particular challenges, given the propensity of HS to affect intimate body areas. To understand the impact of remote consultations on the care of patients with HS, a retrospective analysis was conducted of all consultations from 2 April to 29 October 2020 at the HS clinic at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. In this group of patients with HS, 46.3% were black, compared with 7.0% of patients attending general dermatology clinics (P < 0.001). The majority (65.9%) of patients had previously received or were currently taking adalimumab. All consultations were performed by telephone and in 50.7% of the consultations, patients were assessed as having unstable (u)HS, with 81.1% of these uHS episodes leading to a change in pharmacological therapy. The decision‐making process was aided by patient‐submitted photographs at only 8.1% of consultations involving uHS, for reasons of patient privacy, comfort and data security. The data suggest that HS is an inherently unstable disease despite maximal medical therapy, and this study highlights important reasons for the assessment of patients with HS by FTF consultations where safely possible."
Patient Satisfaction with Virtual-Based Prenatal Care: Implications after the COVID-19 Pandemic,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify factors related to satisfaction with virtual visits during pregnancy in an effort to prioritize intervention targets for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study relied on data obtained from pregnant women (N = 416) who participated in the Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects (PEACE) Study from May 21 to November 22, 2020. Using a cross-sectional design, this study examined factors including COVID-19 related experiences and prenatal care changes in association with patient satisfaction of virtual prenatal care. RESULTS: Overall, women reported being very or extremely satisfied (27.9%) or moderately satisfied (43.5%) with their virtual prenatal experiences, however, 89.9% indicated a preference for in-person care under non-pandemic conditions. Those who completed the survey further into the pandemic were less satisfied with virtual prenatal care (β = − 0.127, p < 0.01). After accounting for this and other sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 pregnancy worries (β = − 0.226, p < 0.001) and the number of prenatal care changes due to the pandemic (β = − 0.137, p < 0.01) were associated with lower satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate general satisfaction with virtual visits among pregnant women in this study although in general women would prefer in-person care if it weren’t for a pandemic. Women worried about the impact of pandemic on their pregnancy, as well as those experiencing transitions in their prenatal care may need more information and reassurance. Additional studies are needed to understand the unmet needs through virtual care compared to in-person care."
Effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections,"Particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the outdoor air pollutants that are major factors in diseases, causing especially adverse respiratory effects in humans. On the other hand, the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory infections is an issue of great importance. The present literature review was aimed at assessing the potential effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections. We have reviewed the scientific literature regarding the association of outdoor air pollution and respiratory viruses on respiratory diseases. Evidence supports a clear association between air concentrations of some pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system. Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19. Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease. This deserves immediate and in-depth experimental investigations."
Monitoring Adult Patients for Intolerance to Gastric Tube Feedings,"ABSTRACT: Gastric tube feeding is a common and valuable intervention for patients in a variety of care settings. While tube feeding can save the lives of patients for whom oral feeding isn't possible, intolerance to tube feeding is a potential complication. This article discusses risk factors for feeding intolerance; the assessment of signs and symptoms of feeding intolerance; the various means of assessing gastric emptying, including the practice of monitoring gastric residual volume (GRV); the controversy surrounding GRV monitoring in assessing feeding tolerance; and the special considerations for monitoring feeding tolerance in acutely and critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019. The author, a nurse researcher with extensive experience in the area of enteral feeding, briefly summarizes recommendations and guidelines for enteral feeding published by national and international health care organizations between 2015 and 2020, and offers her perspective on best nursing practices for monitoring food tolerance in adults."
Developmental Manifestations of Grief in Children and Adolescents: Caregivers as Key Grief Facilitators,"The death of a loved one represents one of the most distressing and potentially traumatic life events in childhood and adolescence. Grief reactions in youth are influenced by ongoing developmental processes and manifest differently depending on the child’s age and developmental stage. These grief-related processes unfold within youths’ caregiving context, as children and adolescents rely heavily on the adults in their environment to navigate and cope with the death of a loved one. Despite the field’s increasing recognition of the potential for maladaptive grief reactions to impede functioning over time, few longitudinal research studies on childhood grief currently exist. In this article, we will (a) provide a brief overview of the childhood bereavement literature; (b) review the new DSM-5 and ICD-11 Prolonged Grief Disorder diagnostic criteria through a developmentally-informed lens; (c) describe how grief reactions manifest in children and adolescents of different ages through the lenses of multidimensional grief theory and relational developmental systems theory; (d) highlight key moderating factors that may influence grief in youth, and (e) discuss a primary moderating factor, the caregiving environment, and the potential mechanisms through which caregivers influence children’s grief."
Rapid Identification of Druggable Targets and the Power of the PHENotype SIMulator for Effective Drug Repurposing in COVID-19,"The current, rapidly diversifying pandemic has accelerated the need for efficient and effective identification of potential drug candidates for COVID-19. Knowledge on host-immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, remains limited with very few drugs approved to date. Viable strategies and tools are rapidly arising to address this, especially with repurposing of existing drugs offering significant promise. Here we introduce a systems biology tool, the PHENotype SIMulator, which – by leveraging available transcriptomic and proteomic databases – allows modeling of SARS-CoV-2 infection in host cells in silico to i) determine with high sensitivity and specificity (both > 96%) the viral effects on cellular host-immune response, resulting in a specific cellular SARS-CoV-2 signature and ii) utilize this specific signature to narrow down promising repurposable therapeutic strategies. Powered by this tool, coupled with domain expertise, we have identified several potential COVID-19 drugs including methylprednisolone and metformin, and further discern key cellular SARS-CoV-2-affected pathways as potential new druggable targets in COVID-19 pathogenesis."
"Different Responses to Stress, Health Practices, and Self-Care during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Stratified Analysis","The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to analyze the differential impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (3 April 2020) on stress, health practices, and self-care activities across different Hispanic countries, age range, and gender groups. One thousand and eighty-two participants from Spain, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador took part in this study. Irrespective of the country, and controlling for income level, young people, especially females, suffered a greater level of stress, perceived the situation as more severe, showed less adherence to health guidelines, and reported lower levels of health consciousness, in comparison to their male peers and older groups. However, in the case of self-care, it seems that older and female groups are generally more involved in self-care activities and adopt more healthy daily routines. These results are mostly similar between Colombia, Ecuador, and Spain. However, Chile showed some different tendencies, as males reported higher levels of healthy daily routines and better adherence to health guidelines compared to females and people over the age of 60. Differences between countries, genders, and age ranges should be considered in order to improve health recommendations and adherence to guidelines. Moreover, developing community action and intersectoral strategies with a gender-based approach could help to reduce health inequalities and increase the success of people’s adherence to health guidelines and self-care-promoting interventions. Future studies should be addressed to explore the possible causations of such differences in more cultural-distant samples and at later stages of the current outbreak."
Assessment of Respiratory Function in Infants and Young Children Wearing Face Masks During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"IMPORTANCE: Face masks have been associated with effective prevention of diffusion of viruses via droplets. However, the use of face masks among children, especially those aged younger than 3 years, is debated, and the US Centers for Disease Control and American Academy of Physicians recommend the use of face mask only among individuals aged 3 years or older. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the use of surgical facial masks among children is associated with episodes of oxygen desaturation or respiratory distress. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted from May through June 2020 in a secondary-level hospital pediatric unit in Italy. Included participants were 47 healthy children divided by age (ie, group A, aged ≤24 months, and group B, aged >24 months to ≤144 months). Data were analyzed from May through June 2020. INTERVENTIONS: All participants were monitored every 15 minutes for changes in respiratory parameters for the first 30 minutes while not wearing a surgical face mask and for the next 30 minutes while wearing a face mask. Children aged 24 months and older then participated in a walking test for 12 minutes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in respiratory parameters during the use of surgical masks were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 47 children, 22 children (46.8%) were aged 24 months or younger (ie, group A), with 11 boys (50.0%) and median (interquartile range [IQR]) age 12.5 (10.0-17.5) months, and 25 children (53.2%) were aged older than 24 months to 144 months or younger, with 13 boys (52.0%) and median (IQR) age 100.0 (72.0-120.0) months. During the first 60 minutes of evaluation in the 2 groups, there was no significant change in group A in median (IQR) partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (Petco(2); 33.0 [32.0-34.0] mm Hg; P for Kruskal Wallis = .59), oxygen saturation (Sao(2); 98.0% [97.0%-99.0%]; P for Kruskal Wallis = .61), pulse rate (PR; 130.0 [115.0-140.0] pulsations/min; P for Kruskal Wallis = .99), or respiratory rate (RR; 30.0 [28.0-33.0] breaths/min; P for Kruskal Wallis = .69) or for group B in median (IQR) Petco(2) (36.0 [34.0-38.0] mm Hg; P for Kruskal Wallis = .97), Sao(2) (98.0% [97.0%-98.0%]; P for Kruskal Wallis = .52), PR (96.0 [84.0-104.5] pulsations/min; P for Kruskal Wallis test = .48), or RR (22.0 [20.0-25.0] breaths/min; P for Kruskal Wallis = .55). After the group B walking test, compared with before the walking test, there was a significant increase in median (IQR) PR (96.0 [84.0-104.5] pulsations/min vs 105.0 [100.0-115.0] pulsations/min; P < .02) and RR (22.0 [20.0-25.0] breaths/min vs 26.0 [24.0-29.0] breaths/min; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study among infants and young children in Italy found that the use of facial masks was not associated with significant changes in Sao(2) or Petco(2), including among children aged 24 months and younger."
DT07: The impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on dermatology ST3 application preparation: a national survey of junior doctors in the UK,
Dietary obesity in mice is associated with lipid deposition and metabolic shifts in the lungs sharing features with the liver,"Obesity is associated with both chronic and acute respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. Anatomical but also systemic and local metabolic alterations are proposed contributors to the pathophysiology of lung diseases in the context of obesity. To bring perspective to this discussion, we used NMR to compare the obesity-associated metabolomic profiles of the lung with those of the liver, heart, skeletal muscles, kidneys, brain and serum from male C57Bl/6J mice fed with a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFHSD) diet vs. standard (SD) chow for 14 weeks. Our results showed that the lung was the second most affected organ after the liver, and that the two organs shared reduced one-carbon (1C) metabolism and increased lipid accumulation. Altered 1C metabolism was found in all organs and in the serum, but serine levels were increased only in the lung of HFHSD compared to SD. Lastly, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-derived metabolites were specifically and oppositely regulated in the serum and kidneys but not in other organs. Collectively, our data highlighted that HFHSD induced specific metabolic changes in all organs, the lung being the second most affected organ, the main alterations affecting metabolite concentrations of the 1C pathway and, to a minor extend, TCA. The absolute metabolite quantification performed in this study reveals some metabolic specificities affecting both the liver and the lung, that may reveal common metabolic determinants to the ongoing pathological process."
In situ exopolysaccharides produced by Lactobacillus helveticus MB2-1 and its effect on gel properties of Sayram ketteki yoghurt,"In order to study the mechanism of high viscosity of Sayram ketteki yoghurt, the growth, acidification properties, in situ exopolysaccharides (EPS) production of Lactobacillus helveticus MB2-1 in milk medium were investigated. The microstructure of the yoghurt was analyzed. The characteristics of in situ EPS produced by this strain in yoghurt were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) analysis. The amount of in situ EPS produced could be up to 689.47â¯mg/L. The micrographs of Sayram ketteki yoghurt demonstrated that the in situ EPS secreted by ropy L. helveticus MB2-1 were closely connected with proteins, effectively filling the three-dimensional network structure of casein clusters, thereby resulting in high viscosity of yoghurt. Besides, the molecular weight of in situ EPS was 9.34â¯×â¯104â¯Da, and the in situ EPS was determined to be a new heteropolysaccharide, containing fucose, which made it unique. Moreover, the set yoghurts added with in situ EPS were demonstrated fine effects on the texture improvement. These results illustrated that L. helveticus MB2-1 could be set as a good starter and the in situ EPS could be considered as a probiotic stabilizer substitute for fermented dairy products."
Targeting acute kidney injury in COVID-19,"As of 15 August 2020, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in >21 million people world-wide and is responsible for more than 750,000 deaths. The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been reported to be as high as 43%. This is comparable to AKI in other forms of pneumonia requiring hospitalization, as well as in non-infectious conditions like cardiac surgery. The impact of AKI on COVID-19 outcomes is difficult to assess at present but, similar to other forms of sepsis, AKI is strongly associated with hospital mortality. Indeed, mortality is reported to be very low in COVID-19 patients without AKI. Given that AKI contributes to fluid and acid–base imbalances, compromises immune response and may impair resolution of inflammation, it seems likely that AKI contributes to mortality in these patients. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19 are thought to be multifactorial including systemic immune and inflammatory responses induced by viral infection, systemic tissue hypoxia, reduced renal perfusion, endothelial damage and direct epithelial infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Mitochondria play a central role in the metabolic deregulation in the adaptive response to the systemic inflammation and are also found to be vital in response to both direct viral damage and tissue reperfusion. These stress conditions are associated with increased glycolysis and reduced fatty acid oxidation. Thus, there is a strong rationale to target AKI for therapy in COVID-19. Furthermore, many approaches that have been developed for other etiologies of AKI such as sepsis, inflammation and ischemia–reperfusion, have relevance in the treatment of COVID-19 AKI and could be rapidly pivoted to this new disease."
A Two-Tube Multiplex Reverse Transcription PCR Assay for Simultaneous Detection of Sixteen Human Respiratory Virus Types/Subtypes,"There is a need for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens. With an intended application in provincial Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, in this study, we present a two-tube multiplex RT-PCR assay (two-tube assay) using automatic electrophoresis to simultaneously detect sixteen common respiratory viruses. The specificity and the sensitivity of the assay were tested. The assay could detect 20–200 copies per reaction when each viral type was assayed individually, 2000 copies with 9 premixed viral targets in the multiplexed assay in tube 1, and 200 copies with 8 premixed templates in tube 2. A total of 247 specimens were used to evaluate the two-tube assay, and the results were compared with those obtained from the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay. The discordant results were confirmed by sequencing or by the Seeplex RV15 ACE detection kit. There were no false positives, but six false negatives occurred with the two-tube assay. In conclusion, the two-tube assay is demonstrated to have great potential for routine surveillance of respiratory virus infection in China."
"Proximity to International Airports and Early Transmission of COVID-19 in the United States—An Epidemiological Assessment of the Geographic Distribution of 490,000 Cases","BACKGROUND: Identifying hotspots in a pandemic is essential for early containment. In the context of the rapid global dissemination of the Covid-19 pandemic, describing viral infection rates in relation to international air travel early during the pandemic can help inform future public health policy. The objective of this study is to determine whether proximity to an international airport predicted higher infection rates during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States (US). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the authors examined the incidence of Covid-19 in areas near US international airports in the first weeks after detection of Covid-19 in all 50 states, using publicly available county-level incidence of Covid-19 data. They performed a multiple regression to determine the relative effects of population density and air traffic in the Counties Containing Airports (CCA) and the number of Covid-19 cases, and determined the odds of Covid-19 in cities near airports and CCA compared to the rest of the state. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that air traffic was significantly correlated with Covid-19 cases during the initial phase of pandemic while population density was not significantly correlated. Three weeks into the pandemic, the pooled odds of Covid-19 cases in CCA was 2.66 (95%CI [2.64, 2.68], p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The counties in the US containing international airports represented initial hotspots for Covid-19 transmission. Early public health containment efforts focused on these areas may help mitigate disease transmission during future similar novel respiratory virus epidemics."

"Environmental impact of the reported chromatographic methods for the determination of the first FDA-Approved therapy for COVID-19 Patients, Remdesivir: A comparative study","Remdesivir (REM) is considered the first therapeutic option approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical care in case of hospitalized patients suffering in COVID-19 epidemic. In the presented multilateral comparative search, four eco friendlessness approaches —National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), Eco-Scale Assessment (ESA), Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI), and Analytical Greenness metric (AGREE) are tested to assess 16 analytical chromatographic procedures reported for the analysis of the commonly used antiviral drug; Remdesivir (REM). The values of testing more than one approach when estimating the eco-friendly characters for analytical methods are illustrated in this study. On the light of the outcomes, ESA and AGREE approaches are recommended as they are easily applied and digitally presented. Furthermore, GAPI is also a reliable tool in terms of comprehensiveness for the whole analytical procedures, from sampling till the final assessment. NEMI is the easiest and fastest greenness evaluation tool; however, the information it provides is particularly of limited scope and sometimes inaccurate. To ensure greenness of chromatographic analytical methods, there must be clear planning beforehand, to reduce chemical hazards sent to environment. Additionally, it is highly recommended in method validation protocols to consider the greenness of a given analytical procedure before releasing to routine use. The LC-MS/MS analysis for the active metabolite of REM (Nuc) reported by Avataneo et al. and Du et al. proved to be the best bio-analytical methods regarding the environmental aspects depending on the GAPI and AGREE tools. However, the HPLC method for REM analysis in intravenous solution reported by Jitta et al. proved to be the greenest analytical method for determination of REM in the pharmaceutical dosage forms according to the ESA, GAPI, and AGREE tools."
Viral communities associated with porcine diarrhoeal disease and genetic characterization of a bufavirus in Tibetan pigs in China,"To investigate the viral communities in diarrhoeal faeces of Tibetan pigs, 146 diarrhoeic samples were collected from 16 pigs farms on the Tibetan plateau. Nineteen viruses belonging to eleven viral taxonomic families were identified in a pooled library. Metagenomics analysis revealed that the viruses were mainly small linear and circular DNA viruses. Furthermore, sequences of 10 NS1 genes and two complete genomes of PBuVs were obtained by PCR amplification. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed that the PBuVs from Tibetan pigs displayed more abundant genetic diversity than those from domestic pigs. This is the first description of the faecal viral community in Tibetan pigs associated with diarrhoea.

BCG vaccination of Diversity Outbred mice induces cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, the only vaccine against tuberculosis, induces cross-protection against pathogens unrelated to Mycobacterium, including viruses. Epidemiological studies have identified potential benefits of BCG vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection. While BCG’s heterologous effects have been widely attributable to trained immunity, we hypothesized BCG vaccination could induce cross-reactive antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1. The concentration of IgG reactive to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from the sera of BCG-vaccinated, Diversity Outbred (DO) mice and C57BL/6J inbred mice was measured using ELISA. Sera from 10/15 BCG-vaccinated DO mice possessed more IgG reactive to recombinant spike protein than sera from BCG-vaccinated C57BL/6J mice and unvaccinated DO mice. Amino acid sequences common to BCG cell wall/membrane proteins and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were identified as potential antigen candidates for future study. These results imply a humoral mechanism, influenced by genotype, by which BCG vaccination could confer immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Graphic Abstract"
Protease-Based Subunit Vaccine in Mice Boosts BCG Protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"The significant number of people with latent and active tuberculosis infection requires further efforts to develop new vaccines or improve the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is the only approved vaccine against this disease. In this study, we developed a recombinant fusion protein (PEPf) containing high-density immunodominant epitope sequences from Rv0125, Rv2467, and Rv2672 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteases that proved immunogenic and used it to develop a recombinant BCG vaccine expressing the fusion protein. After challenging using Mtb, a specific immune response was recalled, resulting in a reduced lung bacterial load with similar protective capabilities to BCG. Thus BCG PEPf failed to increase the protection conferred by BCG. The PEPf was combined with Advax4 adjuvant and tested as a subunit vaccine using a prime-boost strategy. PEPf + Advax4 significantly improved protection after Mtb challenge, with a reduction in bacterial load in the lungs. Our results confirm that Mtb proteases can be used to develop vaccines against tuberculosis and that the use of the recombinant PEPf subunit protein following a prime-boost regimen is a promising strategy to improve BCG immunity."

Consistent Divisions or Methodological Decisions? Assessing the U.S. Racial Hierarchy Across Outcomes,"Scholars have offered a range of perspectives on the twenty-first century racial landscape with little consensus about either the current state of the U.S. racial hierarchy or its future trajectory. We offer a more comprehensive assessment, using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to study racial stratification across a number of socioeconomic outcomes. We pay particular attention to the robustness of results across different categorization schemes that account for self-identification and interviewer classification, as well as racial fluidity. Although we observe that White and Asian Americans generally have the best socioeconomic outcomes, on average, while Black Americans and American Indians have the worst, we also find meaningful differences in patterns of stratification both across outcomes and depending on how race is operationalized. These differences in stratification are reflected in the estimated number of strata as well as the rank order of racial categories. Our results suggest that ongoing debates about the nature of the U.S. racial hierarchy can be partly explained by methodological decisions about which outcomes to study and how best to measure race.

Development and simulation of fully glycosylated molecular models of ACE2-Fc fusion proteins and their interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding domain,"We develop fully glycosylated computational models of ACE2-Fc fusion proteins which are promising targets for a COVID-19 therapeutic. These models are tested in their interaction with a fragment of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike Protein S of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We see that some ACE2 glycans interact with the S fragments, and glycans are influencing the conformation of the ACE2 receptor. Additionally, we optimize algorithms for protein glycosylation modelling in order to expedite future model development. All models and algorithms are openly available."
Mathematical Modeling of COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent,"The present work aims to give a contribution to the understanding of the highly infectious pandemic caused by the COVID-19 in the African continent. The study focuses on the modelling and the forecasting of COVID-19 spread in the most affected African continent, namely: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and South Africa and for the sake of comparison two of the most affected European country are also considered, namely: France and Italy. To this end, an epidemiological SEIQRDP model is presented, which is an adaptation of the classic SIR model widely used in mathematical epidemiology. In order to better coincide with the preventive measures taken by the governments to deal with the spread of COVID-19, this model considers the quarantine. For the identification of the models parameters, official data of the pandemic up to August 1st, 2020 are considered. The results show that the number of infections due to the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided the isolation is effective. However, it is increasing in some countries with the early lifting of containment. Finally, the information provided by the SEIQRDP model could help to establish a realistic assessment of the short-term pandemic situation. Moreover, this will help maintain the most appropriate and necessary public health measures after the lockdown lifting."
Global lockdown: An effective safeguard in responding to the threat of COVID‐19,"RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES: The recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID‐19) has infected around 1 560 000 individuals till 10 April 2020, which has resulted in 95 000 deaths globally. While no vaccine or anti‐viral drugs for COVID‐19 are available, lockdown acts as a protective public health measures to reduce human interaction and lower transmission. The study aims to explore the impact of delayed planning or lack of planning for the lockdown and inadequate implementation of the lockdown, on the transmission rate of COVID‐19. METHOD: Epidemiological data on the incidence and mortality of COVID‐19 cases as reported by public health authorities were accessed from six countries based on total number of infected cases, namely, United States and Italy (more than 100 000 cases); United Kingdom, and France (50 000‐100 000 cases), and India and Russia (6000‐10 000 cases). The Bayesian inferential technique was used to observe the changes (three points) in pattern of number of cases on different duration of exposure (in days) in these selected countries 1 month after World Health Organization (WHO) declaration about COVID‐19 as a global pandemic. RESULTS: On comparing the pattern of transmission rates observed in these six countries at posterior estimated change points, it is found that partial implementation of lockdown (in the United States), delayed planning in lockdown (Russia, United Kingdom, and France), and inadequate implementation of the lockdown (in India and Italy) were responsible to the spread of infections. CONCLUSIONS: In order to control the spreading of COVID‐19, like other national and international laws, lockdown must be implemented and enforced. It is suggested that on‐time or adequate implementation of lockdown is a step towards social distancing and to control the spread of this pandemic."
The Ethical Foundations of Buddhist Cognitive Models: Presentations of Greed and Fear in the Theravada Abhidhamma,"While issues related to greed and fear are ubiquitous in everyday life, they become particularly evident in crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, when societal responses are frequently based on either fear of the disease or craving for the reestablishment of pre-pandemic ""normal"" life. In this context, a question can be posed whether it is possible to approach and understand these phenomena in other ways, and consequently respond in a different manner. In search for alternative approaches to the problem of human greed and fear, this article investigates their conceptualisations from the perspective of the Theravada Abhidhamma, an important formulation of ancient Indian Buddhist philosophy. The Abbidhamma analyses and expounds the processes of cognition, using a multivalent and complex structure, comprised of interrelated and interdependent components (dhamma), which are involved in the ever-changing flow of mental and physical phenomena. This article proposes that the entirety of the structural cognitive model of the Abbidbamma is founded on, and permeated by ethics. The components involved in cognitive processes are classified in three ways, as ethical, unethical, or indeterminate;greed and fear are presented as components of unethical mental states, which in turn may lead to actions that are harmful to oneself and society. This Abhidhammic analysis of cognition provides a model, in which a different conceptualisation of greed and fear is presented;it identifies those components and conditions for cognition which allow for an ethical (kusala) stance and consequently ethical actions. The article thus propounds that the knowledge of cognitive models of ancient India can be relevant to the search for new approaches to contemporary ethical challenges, and may contribute to a different understanding of, and responses to, greed and fear."
Molecular Basis of the Therapeutical Potential of Clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.) and Clues to Its Anti-COVID-19 Utility,"The current COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is enormously affecting the worldwide health and economy. In the wait for an effective global immunization, the development of a specific therapeutic protocol to treat COVID-19 patients is clearly necessary as a short-term solution of the problem. Drug repurposing and herbal medicine represent two of the most explored strategies for an anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.) is a well-known culinary spice that has been used for centuries in folk medicine in many disorders. Interestingly, traditional medicines have used clove since ancient times to treat respiratory ailments, whilst clove ingredients show antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Other interesting features are the clove antithrombotic, immunostimulatory, and antibacterial effects. Thus, in this review, we discuss the potential role of clove in the frame of anti-COVID-19 therapy, focusing on the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic effects of clove and its molecular constituents described in the scientific literature."
COVIDReady2 Study Protocol: Cross-sectional Survey of Medical Student Volunteering and Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom,"Background and objectives: Covid-19 has led to global disruption of healthcare. Many students volunteered to provide clinical support. Volunteering to work in a clinical capacity was a unique medical education opportunity; however, it is unknown whether this was a positive learning experience or which volunteering roles were of most benefit to students. Methods and Design: The COVIDReady2 study is a national cross-sectional study of all medical students at UK medical schools. The primary outcome is to explore the experiences of medical students who volunteered during the pandemic in comparison to those who did not. We will compare responses to determine the educational benefit and issues they faced. In addition to quantitative analysis, thematic analysis will be used to identify themes in qualitative responses. Discussion: There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that service roles have potential to enhance medical education; yet, there is a shortage of studies able to offer practical advice for how these roles may be incorporated in future medical education. We anticipate that this study will help to identify volunteer structures that have been beneficial for students, so that similar infrastructures can be used in the future, and help inform medical education in a non-pandemic setting."
COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency Department (COPE),"Background and aim: The COVID-19 pandemic is putting extraordinary pressure on emergency departments (EDs). To support decision making about hospital admission, we aimed to develop a simple and valid model for predicting mortality and need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) in suspected-COVID-19 patients presenting at the ED. Methods: For model development, we included patients that presented at the ED and were admitted to 4 large Dutch hospitals with suspected COVID-19 between March and August 2020, the first wave of the pandemic in the Netherlands. Based on prior literature we included patient characteristics, vital parameters and blood test values, all measured at ED admission, as potential predictors. Logistic regression analyses with post-hoc uniform shrinkage was used to obtain predicted probabilities of in-hospital death and of being admitted to the ICU, both within 28 days after admission. Model performance (AUC; calibration plots, intercepts and slopes) was assessed with temporal validation in patients who presented between September and December 2020 (second wave). We used multiple imputation to account for missing predictor values. Results: The development data included 5,831 patients who presented at the ED and were hospitalized, of whom 629 (10.8%) died and 5,070 (86.9%) were discharged within 28 days after admission. A simple model -- named COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency Department (COPE) -- with linear age and logarithmic transforms of respiratory rate, CRP, LDH, albumin and urea captured most of the ability to predict death within 28 days. Patients who were admitted in the first month of the pandemic had substantially increased risk of death (odds ratio 1.99; 95% CI 1.61-2.47). COPE was well-calibrated and showed good discrimination for predicting death in 3,252 patients of the second wave (AUC in 4 hospitals: 0.82; 0.82; 0.79; 0.83). COPE was also able to identify patients at high risk of needing IC in second wave patients below the age of 70 (AUC 0.84; 0.81), but overestimated ICU admission for low-risk patients. The models are implemented as a web-based application. Conclusion: COPE is a simple tool that is well able to predict mortality and ICU admission for patients who present to the ED with suspected COVID-19 and may help to inform patients and doctors when deciding on hospital admission."

Disentangling primer interactions improves SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing by multiplex tiling PCR,"Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to almost every nation in the world. Soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, as sample’s viral load become low, rapid decrease in abundances of several amplicons were seen. In this report, we will show that dimer formations between some primers are the major cause of coverage bias in the multiplex PCR. Based on this, we propose 12 alternative primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions. The resulting primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), exhibits improved overall coverage compared to the ARTIC Network’s original (V1) and modified (V3) primer set."

Lung Barrier Function in COVID-19?,"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 appears to strike some people more intensely than others. Some people only experience mild symptoms while others require hospitalization and ventilation. With the virus becoming more prevalent day by day, it is not just the elderly, but even young people are falling seriously ill. Various researchers across the world state that specific cells in the nasal passages, intestines, and lungs may be more susceptible to the infection. Shifting the focus and research towards epithelium might provide new insight towards understanding COVID-19. This article is an overview of how epithelium permeability in COVID-19 may associate with comorbidities and other factors."
COVID pandemic analysis using Auto- Regression-Based moving average method,"COVID (Corona Virus) 2019 proved to be a pandemic worldwide, with more than 30 lakhs of life’s in danger and more than 2 lakh people dead as of 01 May 2020. The disease is spreading across the world in various phases, with assumptions of having an impact based on the weather conditions, where the true reason is not yet confirmed. However, several precautionary measures such as maintaining social distancing, covering mouth and hands using masks and gloves, avoiding huge public gatherings to attend conferences, meetings, worship places, etc proved to put a pause on the spread of this air-borne contagious disease. Though there is an impact on the overall economy world-wide, lockdown is strictly implemented in countries like India and also at various other places to control the spread and save several lives. There is a necessity to track the spread to find out the rate at which the virus is spreading and accordingly taking measures to control the same. This work presents an analysis of the growth rate and death rate of the COVID pandemic in developing countries like India using the Auto regression-based Moving Average method. The results presented in this work show the future predictions analyzed via the proposed model and drives a path to take preventive measures accordingly and curb the COVID spread."
Natural resources commodity prices volatility and economic performance: Evidence from China pre and post COVID-19,"Volatility in the prices of natural resources particularly in the Covid-19 period is the subject of major concern in recent times. Although many studies have empirically investigated the influence of oil prices on economic growth and Covid-19 on oil prices. However, the current study contributes to the literature by investigating the causal linkage of natural resources commodity prices and economic growth in the pre and post Covid-19 period for China over the period from January 01, 2019, to April 01, 2021. This study employed the wavelet power spectrum, and the wavelet coherence approaches, and the frequency domain causality test, which is known for the causal identification in the long-run, medium-run, and short-run. The empirical findings reveal that the natural resource commodity prices are more vulnerable than the economic performance particularly in the Covid-19 peak period in China. However, the wavelet coherence approach demonstrates that a bidirectional causal association exists between natural resources commodity prices and economic performance at different frequencies and time periods. Additionally, the frequency domain causality test confirms that the natural resource commodity prices volatility significantly causes economic performance only in the medium-run. Based on the empirical findings, this study recommends that innovative technological and precautionary measures must be taken to accommodate or overcome natural disasters in the future, and tackle natural resources commodity prices volatility."
Superior mesenteric artery thrombosis and small bowel necrosis: An uncommon thromboembolic manifestation in COVID-19 pneumonia,"Thromboembolism is a recognized complication in patients with COVID-19 infection. It is believed that coagulopathy results secondary to severe inflammatory response syndrome with release of cytokines, viral activation of coagulation cascade or viral related vasculitis. Both arterial and venous thromboembolic complications have been described, however venous thromboembolic complications are much far common. We present an uncommon thromboembolic complication of the superior mesenteric artery in a 49-year-old male with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient also developed segmental infarct of his renal transplant. Patients with SARS-COV-2 infection should be closely evaluated and monitored for the development of thromboembolic complications. Prompt evaluation with CT angiography of suspected thromboembolism could help early diagnosis and treatment which can reflect better patients’ outcomes"
Fitness Analysis and Transcriptome Profiling Following Repeated Mild Heat Stress of Varying Frequency in Drosophilamelanogaster Females,"Understanding how repeated stress affects metabolic and physiological functions in the long run is of crucial importance for evaluating anthropogenic pressure on the environment. We investigated fertility, longevity and metabolism in D. melanogaster females exposed to short-term heat stress (38 °C, 1 h) repeated daily or weekly. Daily stress was shown to cause a significant decrease in both fertility and longevity, as well as in body mass and triglyceride (fat) content, but a significant increase in trehalose and glucose content. Weekly stress did not affect longevity and carbohydrate metabolism but resulted in a significant decrease in body mass and fat content. Weekly stress did not affect the total level of fertility, despite sharp fertility drops on the exact days of stressing. However, stressing insects weekly, only in the first two weeks after eclosion, caused a significant increase in the total level of fertility. The analysis of differentially expressed genes in the fat bodies and adjacent tissues of researched groups with the use of RNA-Seq profiling revealed changes in signal pathways related to proteolysis/digestion, heat shock protein 23, and in the tightly linked stress-inducible humoral factor Turandot gene network."
Paired nasopharyngeal and deep lung testing for SARS-CoV2 reveals a viral gradient in critically ill patients: a multi-centre study,"Introduction Samples for diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 can be obtained from the upper (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs) or lower respiratory tract (sputum or tracheal aspirate or broncho-alveolar lavage - BAL). Data from different testing sites indicates different rates of positivity. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows for semi-quantitative estimates of viral load as time to crossing threshold (Ct) is inversely related to viral load. Objectives The objective of our study was to evaluate SARS-CoV2 RNA loads between paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and deep lung (endotracheal aspirate or BAL) samples from critically ill patients. Methods SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results were retrospectively reviewed for 51 critically ill patients from 5 intensive care units in 3 hospitals ; Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge (3 units), Royal Papworth Cambridge (1 unit), and Royal Sunderland Hospital (1 unit). At the times when paired NP and deep lung samples were obtained, one patient had been on oxygen only, 6 patients on non-invasive ventilation, 18 patients on ECMO, and 26 patients mechanically ventilated. Results Results collected showed significant gradient between NP and deep lung viral loads. Median Ct value was 29 for NP samples and 24 for deep lung samples. Of 51 paired samples, 16 were negative (below limit of detection) on NP swabs but positive (above limit of detection) on deep lung sample, whilst 2 were negative on deep sample but positive on NP (both patients were on ECMO). Conclusions It has been suggested that whilst SARS-CoV1 tends to replicate in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV2 replicates more vigorously in the upper respiratory tract. These data challenge that assumption. These data suggest that viral migration to, and proliferation in, the lower respiratory tract may be a key factor in the progression to critical illness and the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Factors which promote this migration should be examined for association with severe COVID-19. From a practical point of view, patients with suspected severe COVID-19 should have virological samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract where-ever possible, as upper respiratory samples have a significant negative rate."

Frequency and Risk Factors for Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 Patients,"Background: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is an uncommon condition in COVID-19 patients. No information about outcome or risk factors is available at the time. The aim of this research is to report on the frequency and risk factors of spontaneous pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: An unmatched case-control study was carried out in a tertiary health-care facility for patients with COVID-19. Electronic files were reviewed to identify patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR. Univariate analysis was used to describe demographic data. Mean differences were calculated using the Mann-Whitney test. Frequency and odds ratios were calculated by standard operations. Results: A total of 271 patients were included in the study. Nine patients showed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and four of them presented associated spontaneous pneumothorax. The most common risk factors associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients were not considered as risk factors for spontaneous pneumomediastinum development. Conclusion: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is an uncommon clinical feature in COVID-19 patients. More research is necessary to formulate statements regarding prevalence, risk factors, and outcome."
An Engineered Receptor-Binding Domain Improves the Immunogenicity of Multivalent SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino-acid fragment of the 1,273-amino-acid S-protein protomer. The RBD is the primary SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitope and a critical target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Here, we show that this RBD conjugated to each of two carrier proteins elicited more potent neutralizing responses in immunized rodents than did a similarly conjugated proline-stabilized S-protein ectodomain. Nonetheless, the native RBD is expressed inefficiently, limiting its usefulness as a vaccine antigen. However, we show that an RBD engineered with four novel glycosylation sites (gRBD) is expressed markedly more efficiently and generates a more potent neutralizing responses as a DNA vaccine antigen than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein, especially when fused to multivalent carriers, such as a Helicobacter pylori ferritin 24-mer. Further, gRBD is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD when administered as a subunit protein vaccine. Our data suggest that multivalent gRBD antigens can reduce costs and doses, and improve the immunogenicity, of all major classes of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."
AR12 (OSU-03012) suppresses GRP78 expression and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication,"AR12 is a derivative of celecoxib which no-longer acts against COX2 but instead inhibits the ATPase activity of multiple chaperone proteins, in particular GRP78. GRP78 acts as a sensor of endoplasmic reticulum stress and is an essential chaperone required for the life cycle of all mammalian viruses. We and others previously demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that AR12 increases autophagosome formation and autophagic flux, enhances virus protein degradation, preventing virus reproduction, and prolonging the survival of infected animals. In this report, we determined whether AR12 could act against SARS-CoV-2. In a dose-dependent fashion AR12 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression in transfected or infected cells. AR12 suppressed the production of infectious virions via autophagosome formation, which was also associated with degradation of GRP78. After AR12 exposure, the colocalization of GRP78 with spike protein was reduced. Knock down of eIF2α prevented AR12-induced spike degradation and knock down of Beclin1 or ATG5 caused the spike protein to localize in LAMP2+ vesicles without apparent degradation. HCT116 cells expressing ATG16L1 T300, found in the majority of persons of non-European descent, particularly from Africa, expressed greater amounts of GRP78 and SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 compared to ATG16L1 A300, predominantly found in Europeans, suggestive that ATG16L1 T300 expression may be associated with a greater ability to be infected and to reproduce SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that AR12 represents a clinically relevant anti-viral drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2."
Antiviral Effects of Plant-Derived Essential Oils and Their Components: An Updated Review,"The presence of resistance to available antivirals calls for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Plant-derived essential oils may serve as alternative sources of virus-induced disease therapy. Previous studies have demonstrated essential oils to be excellent candidates to treat antiviral-resistant infection associated with their chemical complexity which confers broad-spectrum mechanisms of action and non-specific antiviral properties. However, almost no comprehensive reviews are updated to generalize knowledge in this regard and disclose the interplay between the components and their antiviral activities. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the antiviral efficacy of essential oils from a wide range of plant species and their characteristic components, as well as their overall mechanisms of action, focusing on the last decade. The roles of individual components relative to the overall antiviral efficacy of essential oils, together with the antiviral activity of essential oils in comparison with commercial drugs are also discussed. Lastly, the inadequacies in current research and future research are put forward. This review will provide references in the design of new drug prototypes and improve our understanding of the proper applications of essential oils in the future."
International Virtual Simulation Education in Critical Care During COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Description of the Virtual Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute Illness and iNjury Program,"SUMMARY STATEMENT: The Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute Illness and iNjury program is a well-established, interactive, and simulation-based program designed to improve the quality of care delivered in intensive care units. The COVID-19 pandemic created an overwhelming surge of critically ill patients worldwide, and infection control concerns limited healthcare providers' access to in-person and hands-on simulation training when they needed it the most. Virtual simulation offers an alternative to in-person training but is often complex and expensive. We describe our successful development and initial implementation of an inexpensive, simulation-based virtual Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute Illness and iNjury program to address the pressing need for effective critical care training in various resource-limited settings both within and outside of the United States. The overall satisfaction rate (""excellent"" or ""very good"" responses) was 94.4% after the virtual simulation workshop. Our initial experience suggests that virtual interactions can be engaging and build strong relationships, like in-person continuing professional education, even using relatively simple technology. This knowledge-to-practice improvement platform can be readily adapted to other disciplines beyond critical care medicine."

Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura after Ad26.COV2-S Vaccination,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for two highly effective Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. More recently, EUA was granted for the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine which uses traditional virus-based technology. In this vaccine, researchers added the gene for the coronavirus spike protein to modified Adenovirus 26 and named it Ad26.COV2-S. Nearly 7 million doses of the Ad26.COV2-S have been administered as of mid-April 2021. Recently the Federal Drug Administration and Center for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed data involving six reported cases in the United States of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia in people who received the vaccination. All cases were in women between 18 and 48, with symptoms developing six to 13 days after vaccination. A recent study in the United Kingdom reported similar events in 23 patients age 21 to 77, 61% of which were female, with cases of presumed vaccine induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia occurring six to 24 days after vaccination. We report a 62-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of altered mental status. She had received the Ad26.COV2-S vaccine 37 days prior to ED presentation. She developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and no other cause was found. To our knowledge this is the first case in the United States of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura after receiving the Ad26.COV2-S COVID-19 vaccine."
Exploring vaccine hesitancy determinants during the COVID-19 pandemic: An in-depth interview study,"On January 20, 2020, the CDC reported its first case of the novel coronavirus in the United States. Almost a year and a half after the first COVID-19 vaccine was given in the U.S., efforts to vaccinate individuals in the hopes of achieving herd immunity continue. Despite the amounts of scientific breakthroughs to create and disseminate the vaccines, people continue to express hesitancy. Existing research has explored vaccine hesitancy through survey data, restricting an in-depth understanding for why people remain hesitant. As a result, this research aimed to understand in-depth reasons for vaccine hesitancy as well as what finally got those who, although hesitant, went through with getting inoculated. In addition, we also wanted to know how the vaccine hesitant received information about the vaccine. Using in-depth interviews, we identified key elements that influenced vaccine hesitancy which include social pressure to not get vaccinated and lack of trust in the healthcare system. We also identified reasons why vaccine hesitant individuals ultimately decided to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. These reasons included becoming informed, getting back to normal, and societal pressure. Finally, we sought to understand what served as venues for COVID-19 information and those were media sources like traditional news outlets/legacy media (e.g., TV) and digital/social media, and interpersonal sources like family, friends, and co-workers. In revealing these factors through in-depth interviews, we show how complex vaccine hesitancy is and the elements public health practitioners need to take into consideration when constructing vaccine-related information/messages."

Clinical knowledge extraction via sparse embedding regression (KESER) with multi-center large scale electronic health record data,"The increasing availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has created enormous potential for translational research. However, it is difficult to know all the relevant codes related to a phenotype due to the large number of codes available. Traditional data mining approaches often require the use of patient-level data, which hinders the ability to share data across institutions. In this project, we demonstrate that multi-center large-scale code embeddings can be used to efficiently identify relevant features related to a disease of interest. We constructed large-scale code embeddings for a wide range of codified concepts from EHRs from two large medical centers. We developed knowledge extraction via sparse embedding regression (KESER) for feature selection and integrative network analysis. We evaluated the quality of the code embeddings and assessed the performance of KESER in feature selection for eight diseases. Besides, we developed an integrated clinical knowledge map combining embedding data from both institutions. The features selected by KESER were comprehensive compared to lists of codified data generated by domain experts. Features identified via KESER resulted in comparable performance to those built upon features selected manually or with patient-level data. The knowledge map created using an integrative analysis identified disease-disease and disease-drug pairs more accurately compared to those identified using single institution data. Analysis of code embeddings via KESER can effectively reveal clinical knowledge and infer relatedness among codified concepts. KESER bypasses the need for patient-level data in individual analyses providing a significant advance in enabling multi-center studies using EHR data."
How fast does the SARS-Cov-2 virus really mutate in heterogeneous populations?,"We introduce the problem of determining the mutational support of genes in the SARS-Cov-2 virus and estimating the distribution of mutations within different genes using small sample sizes that do not allow for accurate maximum likelihood estimation. The mutational support refers to the unknown number of sites mutated across all strains and individual samples of the SARS-Cov-2 genome; given the high cost and limited availability of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, especially in early stages of infections when only a small number of genomic samples (∼ 1000s) are available that do not allow for determining the exact degree of mutations in an RNA virus that comprises roughly 30, 000 nucleotides. Nevertheless, working with small sample sets is required in order to quickly predict the mutation rate of this and other viruses and get an insight into their transformational power. Furthermore, with the small number of samples available, it is hard to estimate the mutational landscape across different age/gender groups and geographical locations which may be of great importance in assessing different risk categories and factors influencing susceptibility to infection. To this end, we use our state-of-the art polynomial estimator techniques and the Good-Turing estimator to obtain estimates based on only roughly 1, 000 samples per category. Our analysis reveals an interesting finding: the mutational support appears to be statistically more significant in patients which appear to have lower infection rates and handle the exposure with milder symptoms, such as women and people of relatively young age (≤ 55)."

Transfer Learning for Predicting Virus-Host Protein Interactions for Novel Virus Sequences,"Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 infect the human body by forming interactions between virus proteins and human proteins. However, experimental methods to find protein interactions are inadequate: large scale experiments are noisy, and small scale experiments are slow and expensive. Inspired by the recent successes of deep neural networks, we hypothesize that deep learning methods are well-positioned to aid and augment biological experiments, hoping to help identify more accurate virus-host protein interaction maps. Moreover, computational methods can quickly adapt to predict how virus mutations change protein interactions with the host proteins. We propose DeepVHPPI, a novel deep learning framework combining a self-attention-based transformer architecture and a transfer learning training strategy to predict interactions between human proteins and virus proteins that have novel sequence patterns. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in predicting Virus–Human protein interactions for SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, and Ebola. In addition, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict and interpret the interactions of mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences.

Biologics for Non-Cancer Dermatological Diseases: Analysis on China’s Clinical Trial Registration Trend From 2016 to 2020,"Background: In the past 5 years, China has quickly followed US’s steps to approve the new drug application of biologics for dermatological diseases. There is an increasing interest in the current biologic landscape and further potentials in China. Our study aims to analyze features of clinical trials on non-cancer dermatological biologics and synthesize recent achievements and impediments, in order to forecast the development trends in China. Methods: Three registers (the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Center for Drug Evaluation, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for clinical trials of non-cancer dermatological biologics initiated between 2016 and 2020 in mainland China. Trial information (the first posted year, sponsor type, study phase and site, recruitment status, disease, drug target, and drug registration type) and certain study design (selection of the control group, primary efficacy outcome, and inclusion of patient-reported outcome for non–phase I or II trials only) information were extracted and analyzed. Results: A total of 60 trials were identified. The number of registered dermatological biologic trials significantly increased with an annual increase of 59% from 2016 to 2020, primarily driven by psoriasis (47/60, 78.3%) and atopic dermatitis (6/60, 10.0%) trials. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-17 remained the hottest drug targets (17/60, 28.3% for TNF-α and 18/60, 30.0% for IL-17). In addition to TNF-α and IL-17, many new psoriasis drug targets came into place since 2018 (IL-12/23) and 2019 (IL-36 and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)). Thirty percent (18/60) of the trials were conducted for biosimilar products, all of which were sponsored by local pharmaceutical companies and 88.9% of which were targeting on TNF-α. Targets of IL-36, IL-5, and IgE were only available in trials sponsored by global companies. Conclusion: There was great progress on the innovation of dermatological biologics in the past 5 years in China in terms of surged number of clinical trials, increased biosimilars and “me-too” drugs which greatly improved patient access to novel treatments, execution of parallel clinical trials, and improved hospital GCP office and regulatory environment. Further efforts for local pharmaceutical companies should include relocating resources to exploring novel drug targets and dermatological diseases other than psoriasis or atopic dermatitis.

"Temporal and Location Variations, and Link Categories for the Dissemination of COVID-19–Related Information on Twitter During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Europe: Infoveillance Study","BACKGROUND: The spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, across Asia and Europe sparked a significant increase in public interest and media coverage, including on social media platforms such as Twitter. In this context, the origin of information plays a central role in the dissemination of evidence-based information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. On February 2, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) constituted a “massive infodemic” and argued that this situation “makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.” OBJECTIVE: This infoveillance study, conducted during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on the social media platform Twitter. It allows monitoring of the dynamic pandemic situation on a global scale for different aspects and topics, languages, as well as regions and even whole countries. Of particular interest are temporal and geographical variations of COVID-19–related tweets, the situation in Europe, and the categories and origin of shared external resources. METHODS: Twitter’s Streaming application programming interface was used to filter tweets based on 16 prevalent hashtags related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Each tweet’s text and corresponding metadata as well as the user’s profile information were extracted and stored into a database. Metadata included links to external resources. A link categorization scheme—introduced in a study by Chew and Eysenbach in 2009—was applied onto the top 250 shared resources to analyze the relative proportion for each category. Moreover, temporal variations of global tweet volumes were analyzed and a specific analysis was conducted for the European region. RESULTS: Between February 9 and April 11, 2020, a total of 21,755,802 distinct tweets were collected, posted by 4,809,842 distinct Twitter accounts. The volume of #covid19-related tweets increased after the WHO announced the name of the new disease on February 11, 2020, and stabilized at the end of March at a high level. For the regional analysis, a higher tweet volume was observed in the vicinity of major European capitals or in densely populated areas. The most frequently shared resources originated from various social media platforms (ranks 1-7). The most prevalent category in the top 50 was “Mainstream or Local News.” For the category “Government or Public Health,” only two information sources were found in the top 50: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at rank 25 and the WHO at rank 27. The first occurrence of a prevalent scientific source was Nature (rank 116). CONCLUSIONS: The naming of the disease by the WHO was a major signal to address the public audience with public health response via social media platforms such as Twitter. Future studies should focus on the origin and trustworthiness of shared resources, as monitoring the spread of fake news during a pandemic situation is of particular importance. In addition, it would be beneficial to analyze and uncover bot networks spreading COVID-19–related misinformation."

Duck gut viral metagenome analysis captures snapshot of viral diversity,"BACKGROUND: Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) an economically important waterfowl for meat, eggs and feathers; is also a natural reservoir for influenza A viruses. The emergence of novel viruses is attributed to the status of co-existence of multiple types and subtypes of viruses in the reservoir hosts. For effective prediction of future viral epidemic or pandemic an in-depth understanding of the virome status in the key reservoir species is highly essential. METHODS: To obtain an unbiased measure of viral diversity in the enteric tract of ducks by viral metagenomic approach, we deep sequenced the viral nucleic acid extracted from cloacal swabs collected from the flock of 23 ducks which shared the water bodies with wild migratory birds. RESULT: In total 7,455,180 reads with average length of 146 bases were generated of which 7,354,300 reads were de novo assembled into 24,945 contigs with an average length of 220 bases and the remaining 100,880 reads were singletons. The duck virome were identified by sequence similarity comparisons of contigs and singletons (BLASTx E score, <10(−3)) against viral reference database. Numerous duck virome sequences were homologous to the animal virus of the Papillomaviridae family; and phages of the Caudovirales, Inoviridae, Tectiviridae, Microviridae families and unclassified phages. Further, several duck virome sequences had homologous with the insect viruses of the Poxviridae, Alphatetraviridae, Baculoviridae, Densovirinae, Iflaviridae and Dicistroviridae families; and plant viruses of the Secoviridae, Virgaviridae, Tombusviridae and Partitiviridae families, which reflects the diet and habitation of ducks. CONCLUSION: This study increases our understanding of the viral diversity and expands the knowledge about the spectrum of viruses harboured in the enteric tract of ducks."
"Efficacy of Digitally Supported and Real-Time Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose-Driven Counseling in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Real-World, Retrospective Study in North India","PURPOSE: Poor glycemic control is prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in India. This study aims to understand the effectiveness of a smartphone-connected glucometer, real-time feedback, and contextualized counseling on glycemic control and hypoglycemic episodes in T2DM patients. METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter study reviewed the medical records of T2DM patients belonging to several cities of north India, who were digitally engaged with a smartphone-connected glucometer and who had received at least one counseling session between September 2019 and July 2020. Intervention included self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) using a smartphone-connected glucometer enabled with real-time transmission of information to certified diabetes educators (CDE) and their corresponding counseling based on SMBG findings. RESULTS: Of 7111 adult T2DM patients included in this study, majority (75%) of the patients received a single session of counseling, and the remaining patients received 2 (16.7%), 3 (5%), 4 (2%), or ≥5 (1.3%) sessions. The mean age of the patients was 51.6 years, and the majority (77.9%) were males. Digital monitoring of BG and counseling with CDE significantly reduced the mean fasting (by 9.6%), pre-prandial (by 9.9%), and post-prandial (by 9.2%) BG values in 53%, 52%, and 54% of patients, respectively. The majority (81.4%) of patients showed no hypoglycemic episode (≤70 mg/dL) post-counseling. The hypoglycemia episodes observed with FBG, pre-prandial, and post-prandial BG values were reduced significantly by 58.5%, 48.1%, and 61.8%, respectively, post-counseling. CONCLUSION: Digitally supported and real-time SMBG-driven counselling was effective in glycemic control and reduction of hypoglycemic episodes in T2DM patients in India. Moreover, reduction in hypoglycemia may be due to back end real-time support of CDE intervention."
An intelligent framework to predict socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 and public sentiments(),"The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has extremely shaken the whole world. COVID-19 has increased human distress, damaged the global economy, flipped the lives of many people around the world upside down, and has had a huge effect on the health, economic, environmental, and social sectors. This study aims to determine the social and economic trends in the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan. Machine learning techniques learn patterns from historical data and make predictions on its basis. Furthermore, an online survey has been conducted to collect data and a total of 410 responses are collected. Machine learning techniques have been used to highlight the impact of COVID-19 on daily life.

Convalescent Blood Products in COVID-19: A Narrative Review,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has left the world in a state of desolation with overburdening public health systems in a short period. Finding possible preventative and therapeutic measures to counter severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has been the priority. A possible solution is convalescent blood products (CBP), primarily convalescent plasma (CP) and immunoglobulins, as an adjunctive therapy. CBP has been tried on the previous coronavirus epidemics with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Therefore, we reviewed the clinical utility of CBP and available evidence in COVID-19. We found some of the current anecdotal studies demonstrate promising therapeutic potential, but many of these studies do not meet the academic rigours to substantiate its use with confidence. However, the compassionate use of CBP in critically ill COVID-19 patients can be an option while we await a definitive answer from ongoing randomised clinical trials."
Decreased door-to-balloon time in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction during the early COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea - an observational study,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in a marked decrease in the number of patient visits for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and delayed patient response and intervention in several countries. This study evaluated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patients, patient response time (pain-to-door), and intervention time (door-to-balloon) for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Methods: Patients with STEMI or NSTEMI visiting a hospital in South Korea who underwent primary coronary intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 29, 2020, to December 31, 2020) were compared with those in the equivalent period in 2018 to 2019. Patient response and intervention times were compared for the COVID-19 pandemic window (2020) and the equivalent period in 2018 to 2019. Results: We observed no decrease in the number of patients with STEMI (P=0.50) and NSTEMI (P=0.94) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to that in the previous years. Patient response times (STEMI: P=0.34; NSTEMI: P=0.89) during the overall COVID-19 pandemic period did not differ significantly. However, we identified a significant decrease in time to intervention among patients with STEMI (14%; p<0.01) during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: We found that the number of patient with STEMI and NSTEMI was consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic and that no time delays in patient response and intervention occurred. However, the door-to-balloon time among patients with STEMI significantly reduced during the early COVID-19 pandemic, which could be attributed to reduced emergency care utilization during the early pandemic."
"Efficacy, safety and drug survival of thioguanine as maintenance treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: a retrospective multi-centre study in the United Kingdom","BACKGROUND: Thioguanine (TG) is a thiopurine which has been used for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who have failed azathioprine (AZA) or mercaptopurine (MP) due to adverse events or suboptimal response. Its widespread use has been hampered due to concerns about nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose TG therapy in IBD patients failing AZA and MP. METHODS: A retrospective multicentre study was performed in IBD patients who failed prior treatment with conventional thiopurines with or without following immunomodulation (thiopurine-allopurinol, biologicals, methotrexate, tacrolimus) and were subsequently treated with TG as rescue monotherapy between 2003 and 2019 at three hospitals in the United Kingdom. Clinical response, adverse events, laboratory results, imaging and liver biopsies were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: A total of 193 patients (57% female and 64% Crohn’s disease) were included, with a median daily TG dose of 20 mg (range: 20–40 mg), a median treatment duration of 23 months (IQR 10–47) and a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR 22–53). The clinical response rate at 12 months was 65 and 54% remained on TG until the end of follow-up. Adverse events consisted primarily of elevated liver tests (6%), myelotoxicity (7%) and rash (5%). NRH was histologically diagnosed in two patients and two other patients (1%) developed non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The median 6-TGN and TPMT levels were 953 pmol/8 × 10(5) RBC (IQR 145–1761) and 47 mu/L (IQR 34.5–96). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up suggests that TG can be an effective and well-tolerated therapy in more than half of difficult-to-treat and multi-therapy failing IBD patients. Findings of this study indicate that TG can be used safely and the occurrence of hepatotoxicity was low. The incidence rate of NRH was within the background incidence."
The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Breast Cancer Patients,"Objective: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic causes delays in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients due to fear of contagion and lockdown. This study aims to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer patients treated in our breast center. Materials and Methods: Patients who applied to our clinic with the diagnosis of invasive breast cancer in March 2020 and March 2021 (Study Group) when the COVID-19 pandemic was observed, and in March 2019 and March 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic (Control Group) were compared in terms of demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 21. Results: There were 176 (46%) patients in the study and 206 (54%) patients in the control group. Almost a 15% reduction was detected in patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate of pre-menopausal patients and patient-related delay time (PRDT) were significantly higher in SG (57.7% vs. %45, p=0.013, 2.58 vs. 1.82-month, p=0.001, respectively). There was a larger tumor size and more metastatic lymph nodes after NAC in the SG, but the differences were not significant. There was no difference regarding breast cancer stages and molecular subtypes between the two groups, but there was significantly more de novo stage IV breast cancer in the SG (p=0.009). The incidence of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and type of surgical therapy was similar between the two groups. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic caused a decrease in the number of patients who applied to our clinic and increased patient-related delay time due to fear of transmission and lockdown. The rate of de novo stage IV breast cancer was also significantly increased."
Improved Glycemic Control With a Digital Health Intervention in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: Retrospective Study,"BACKGROUND: Traditional lifestyle interventions have shown limited success in improving diabetes-related outcomes. Digital interventions with continuously available support and personalized educational content may offer unique advantages for self-management and glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated changes in glycemic control among participants with type 2 diabetes who enrolled in a digital diabetes management program. METHODS: The study employed a single-arm, retrospective design. A total of 950 participants with a hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) baseline value of at least 7.0% enrolled in the Vida Health Diabetes Management Program. The intervention included one-to-one remote sessions with a Vida provider and structured lessons and tools related to diabetes management. HbA(1c) was the primary outcome measure. Of the 950 participants, 258 (27.2%) had a follow-up HbA(1c) completed at least 90 days from program start. Paired t tests were used to evaluate changes in HbA(1c) between baseline and follow-up. Additionally, a cluster-robust multiple regression analysis was employed to evaluate the relationship between high and low program usage and HbA(1c) change. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the difference in HbA(1c) as a function of the measurement period (ie, pre-Vida enrollment, baseline, and postenrollment follow-up). RESULTS: We observed a significant reduction in HbA(1c) of –0.81 points between baseline (mean 8.68, SD 1.7) and follow-up (mean 7.88, SD 1.46; t(257)=7.71; P<.001). Among participants considered high risk (baseline HbA(1c)≥8), there was an average reduction of –1.44 points between baseline (mean 9.73, SD 1.68) and follow-up (mean 8.29, SD 1.64; t(139)=9.14; P<.001). Additionally, average follow-up HbA(1c) (mean 7.82, SD 1.41) was significantly lower than pre-enrollment HbA(1c) (mean 8.12, SD 1.46; F(2, 210)=22.90; P<.001) There was also significant effect of program usage on HbA(1c) change (β=–.60; P<.001) such that high usage was associated with a greater decrease in HbA(1c) (mean –1.02, SD 1.60) compared to low usage (mean –.61, SD 1.72). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control among participants enrolled in a digital diabetes management intervention. Higher program usage was associated with greater improvements in HbA(1c). The findings of the present study suggest that a digital health intervention may represent an accessible, scalable, and effective solution to diabetes management and improved HbA(1c). The study was limited by a nonrandomized, observational design and limited postenrollment follow-up data."
Emergency Management in Dental Clinic During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Epidemic in Beijing,"Background In mid-March 2020, the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was to be characterised as a pandemic. The purpose of this article is to recommend emergency management procedures for dental clinics during this public health emergency. Materials and Methods We have implemented a series of emergency management measures to prevent cross-infection in our dental clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic, including personnel scheduling, division of the clinic into functional areas, limitation or delay of non-emergency patients, staff protection and infection controls, clinical environmental disinfection, and the use of online consultation services, among others. Results Due to public health policy and dental emergency management, the number of dental visitors to our clinic dropped sharply, and no COVID-19 suspected cases or high-risk patients received treatment. There have been no reports of infection of dental staff or patients during dental treatment in China to date. Conclusion These public health policies and dental emergency management measures were effective in controlling cross-infection of COVID-19 in the dental clinic. Practical Implications We share control measures for COVID-19, and hope that they will be helpful for dental professionals worldwide to continue to provide dental care in a safe and orderly manner."
Covid-19: Hospital admissions continue to climb amid record infection rates,
Health and Illness as Enacted Phenomena,"In this paper I explore health and illness through the lens of enactivism, which is understood and developed as a bodily-based worldly-engaged phenomenology. Various health theories – biomedical, ability-based, biopsychosocial – are introduced and scrutinized from the point of view of enactivism and phenomenology. Health is ultimately argued to consist in a central world-disclosing aspect of what is called existential feelings, experienced by way of transparency and ease in carrying out important life projects. Health, in such a phenomenologically enacted understanding, is an important and in many cases necessary part of leading a good life. Illness, on the other hand, by such a phenomenological view, consist in finding oneself at mercy of unhomelike existential feelings, such as bodily pains, nausea, extreme unmotivated tiredness, depression, chronic anxiety and delusion, which make it harder and, in some cases, impossible to flourish. In illness suffering the lived body hurts, resists, or, in other ways, alienates the activities of the ill person."
Neuropsychological measures of “Long COVID-19 Fog” in older subjects,"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 is known to impact older people more severely and to cause a number of persistent symptoms during the recovery phase, including cognitive and neurological ones. Aim of this study is to investigate the cognitive and neurological features of elderly patients with confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 evaluated in the post-acute phase through a direct neuropsychological evaluation. METHODS: Individuals recovering from Covid-19 were assessed in an out-patient practice with a complete neurological evaluation and neuropsychological tests (Mini Mental State Examination; Rey Auditory Verbal Test, Multiple Feature Target Cancellation Test, Trial Making Test, Digit span Forward and Backward, Frontal Assessment Battery). RESULTS: 100 individuals (mean age 73.4±6.1 years, 35% female) assessed on average 96.5 days after the onset of Covid-19 symptoms were included. On average, the adjusted MMSE was 28.2±1.7. Overall, on the neuropsychological assessment, a total of 33 subjects were found to perform at a level considered to be pathological; more specifically, 33%, 23% and 20% of subjects failed on Trial Making, Digit Span Backwards and Frontal Evaluation Battery tests respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 is capable of eliciting persistent measurable neurocognitive alterations particularly relevant in the areas of attention and working memory. These cognitive derangements may represent an early stage of mild cognitive impairment in the elderly and mandate maximum proactivity by healthcare systems in dealing with this condition."

"Structural basis of fitness of emerging SARS-COV-2 variants and considerations for screening, testing and surveillance strategy to contain their threat.","While emergence of new SAS-COV-2 variants is posing grave challenge to efforts to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, the structural and molecular basis of their fitness remain poorly understood. We performed in silico analysis of structures of two most frequent SARS-COV-2 mutations, namely, N501Y and E484K, to identify plausible basis of their fitness over the original strain. The analysis suggested that the N501Y mutation is associated with strengthening of intra- as well as intermolecular H-bond in the hACE2 receptor-spike protein complex, which could result in increased affinity and, therefore, higher infectivity. While E484K mutation did not seem to directly affect the binding with hACE2 receptor, it disrupted H-bonding and salt-bridge interaction associated with binding with neutralizing antibody, which could affect chance of re-infection, disease outcome. Survey of several other mutations showing reduction in antibody-mediated neutralization also revealed that similar disruption of H-bonding or salt-bridge or Van der Waals interaction might explain their phenotype. Analysis of GESS database indicated that N501Y, EK484 as well as these other mutations existed since March-April, 2020, might have evolved independently across the world and may keep accumulating, which could affect efficacy of vaccination and antibody-based therapies. Our analysis also indicated that these may spread in spite of current travel restrictions focused on few countries and evolve indigenously warranting intensification of surveillance for emerging mutations among all travellers as well as people in their dwelling zones. Meta-analysis of existing literature showed that repeat testing of travellers, contacts and others under scrutiny 7-11 days after the initial RT-PCR test may significantly help to contain the spread of emerging variants by catching false negative results. In addition, existing evidence calls for development of strain-specific tests, escalated sequencing and broadening the scope of surveillance including in hospitals and animal farms to contain the threat of emerging variants."
Accurate Reference Gas Mixtures Containing Tritiated Molecules: Their Production and Raman-Based Analysis.,"Highly accurate, quantitative analyses of mixtures of hydrogen isotopologues-both the stable species, H2, D2, and HD, and the radioactive species, T2, HT, and DT-are of great importance in fields as diverse as deuterium-tritium fusion, neutrino mass measurements using tritium β-decay, or for photonuclear experiments in which hydrogen-deuterium targets are used. In this publication we describe a production, handling, and analysis facility capable of fabricating well-defined gas samples, which may contain any of the stable and radioactive hydrogen isotopologues, with sub-percent accuracy for the relative species concentrations. The production is based on precise manometric gas mixing of H2, D2, and T2. The heteronuclear isotopologues HD, HT, and DT are generated via controlled, in-line catalytic reaction or by β-induced self-equilibration, respectively. The analysis was carried out using an in-line intensity- and wavelength-calibrated Raman spectroscopy system. This allows for continuous monitoring of the composition of the circulating gas during the self-equilibration or catalytic evolution phases. During all procedures, effects, such as exchange reactions with wall materials, were considered with care. Together with measurement statistics, these and other systematic effects were included in the determination of composition uncertainties of the generated reference gas samples. Measurement and calibration accuracy at the level of 1% was achieved."
Comparison of prediction methods for treatment continuation of antipsychotics in children and adolescents with schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVE: There is little evidence for finding optimal antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia, especially in paediatrics. To evaluate the performance and clinical benefit of several prediction methods for 1-year treatment continuation of antipsychotics. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Population-based prognostic study conducting using the nationwide claims database in Korea. PARTICIPANTS: 5109 patients aged 2-18 years who initiated antipsychotic treatment with risperidone/aripiprazole for schizophrenia between 2010 and 2017 were identified. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used the conventional logistic regression (LR) and common six machine-learning methods (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, ridge, elstic net, randomforest, gradient boosting machine, and superlearner) to derive predictive models for treatment continuation of antipsychotics. The performance of models was assessed using the Brier score (BS), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The clinical benefit of applying these models was also evaluated by comparing the treatment continuation rate between patients who received the recommended medication by models and patients who did not. RESULTS: The gradient boosting machine showed the best performance in predicting treatment continuation for risperidone (BS, 0.121; AUROC, 0.686; AUPRC, 0.269). Among aripiprazole models, GBM for BS (0.114), SuperLearner for AUROC (0.688) and random forest for AUPRC (0.317) showed the best performance. Although LR showed lower performance than machine learnings, the difference was negligible. Patients who received recommended medication by these models showed a 1.2-1.5 times higher treatment continuation rate than those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: All prediction models showed similar performance in predicting the treatment continuation of antipsychotics. Application of prediction models might be helpful for evidence-based decision-making in antipsychotic treatment."
Severe hemoptysis in post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis precipitated by SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome has been widely descripted. Hemoptysis has rarely been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report here a case of severe hemoptysis in post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis precipitated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and managed in a referral center. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old man was admitted to our intensive care unit for severe hemoptysis with history of post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis. At ICU admission the patient had fever and severe acute respiratory failure requiring high flow oxygen therapy. Respiratory tract sampling was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Multi-detector computed tomography angiography pointed out localized bronchiectasis on the left lower lobe and enlarged left bronchial and phrenic arteries; bronchial arteriography with distal embolization was performed with favorable outcome and no bleeding recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and complicated by severe hemoptysis. Whether the virus may play a role in the dysregulation of airway haemostasis, and contribute to episodes of hemoptysis in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases and predisposing factors might be investigated."
COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0,"Introduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives."
Barriers to Accessing Healthcare Services for People with Parkinson’s Disease: A Scoping Review,"Parkinson’s disease is a complex condition that affects many different aspects of a person’s health. Because of its complexity, people with Parkinson’s disease require access to a variety of healthcare services. The aim of the present study was to identify the barriers to access healthcare services for people with Parkinson’s disease. We conducted a scoping review according to guidelines posed by Arksey & O’Malley (2005). A search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINHAL, and PsycINFO databases was conducted, and 38 articles were selected based on the inclusion criteria. The review findings identified person-level and system-level barriers. The person-level barriers included skills required to seek healthcare services, ability to engage in healthcare and cost for services. The system-level barriers included the availability of appropriate healthcare resources. Based on the existing barriers elucidated in the scope review, we have discussed potential areas in healthcare that require improvement for people with Parkinson’s disease to manage their healthcare needs more equitably."
The Problem of Microbial Dark Matter in Neonatal Sepsis,"Neonatal sepsis (NS) kills 750,000 infants every year. Effectively treating NS requires timely diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy matched to the causative pathogens, but most blood cultures for suspected NS do not recover a causative pathogen. We refer to these suspected but unidentified pathogens as microbial dark matter. Given these low culture recovery rates, many non–culture-based technologies are being explored to diagnose NS, including PCR, 16S amplicon sequencing, and whole metagenomic sequencing. However, few of these newer technologies are scalable or sustainable globally. To reduce worldwide deaths from NS, one possibility may be performing population-wide pathogen discovery. Because pathogen transmission patterns can vary across space and time, computational models can be built to predict the pathogens responsible for NS by region and season. This approach could help to optimally treat patients, decreasing deaths from NS and increasing antimicrobial stewardship until effective diagnostics that are scalable become available globally."
Recomendaciones éticas para la toma de decisiones difíciles en las unidades de cuidados intensivos ante la situación excepcional de crisis por la pandemia por covid-19: revisión rápida y consenso de expertos,"Abstract In view of the exceptional public health situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a consensus work has been promoted from the ethics group of the Spanish Society of the Spanish Society of Intensive, Critical Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC), with the objective of finding some answers from ethics to the crossroads between the increase of people with intensive care needs and the effective availability of means. In a very short period, the medical practice framework has been changed to a ""catastrophe medicine"" scenario, with the consequent change in the decision-making parameters. In this context, the allocation of resources or the prioritization of treatment become crucial elements, and it is important to have an ethical reference framework to be able to make the necessary clinical decisions.For this, a process of narrative review of the evidence has been carried out, followed by u. Unsystematic consensus of experts, which has resulted in both the publication of a position paper and recommendations from SEMICYUC itself, and the consensus between 18 scientific societies and 5 institutes / chairs of bioethics and palliative care of a framework document of reference for general ethical recommendations in this context of crisis."
How to follow-up a patient who received tocilizumab in severe COVID-19: a case report,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is characterized by fast deterioration in the mechanism of cytokine storm. Therefore, treatment with immunomodulating agents should be initiated as soon as hyperinflammation is established. Evidence for the use of tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 is emerging, but the drug in this setting is used “off label” with limited data on both effectiveness and safety. Therefore, Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Warsaw established a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the use of TCZ in severe COVID-19 cases. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present a case of 27-year-old, otherwise healthy man, who was successfully treated with chloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab and a standard of care. Initially the magnitude of lung devastation, clinical deterioration and the need for mechanical ventilation suggested unfavorable prognosis. However, we observed complete regression in radiological changes and rapid clinical improvement. Irrespective of this, patient’s serum interleukin 6 and aminotransferases remained elevated even after a month from treatment. CONCLUSIONS: An overlapping effect of hyperinflammation, hypoxic organ injury and drug-related toxicity warrants a long-term follow-up for COVID-19 survivors. In addition, residual IL-6 receptors blockage may mask new infections. A standardized approach to follow-up for COVID-19 survivors is urgently needed. Current and future research should also investigate the impact of experimental therapies on lung tissue healing and regeneration, as well as long-term treatment toxicities."
Evaluation of Tele-rheumatology during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Asian Population: A Pilot Study,"OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition associated with a potential for deformities. It is one of the common conditions to seek health care. Hence, the present study was conducted to assess the telemedicine services for patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis during the COVID-19 pandemic in an Asian Indian population. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted (March 2020–June 2020) in the telemedicine department of a premier northern Indian tertiary care institution. Out of the total patients enrolled (N = 7577) in telemedicine services, 122 rheumatoid arthritis patients (1.6%) were followed for 1 month to assess change in functional status by modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ). Telephonic interviews of the enrolled patients were conducted to determine the level of understanding of advice given by consultants, barriers during the consultation, and satisfaction with teleconsultations for rheumatology clinics. RESULTS: For the native people, language of the clinicians was the main barrier (20%) in telerheumatology. Saving of time and money was observed as beneficial factors for patients. More than three-quarters of all rheumatoid arthritis patients were ready to use teleconsultation in the near future. A similar proportion of patients were in support for the recommendation of these services to other persons. CONCLUSION: We report the successful use of telemedicine services in the evaluation and management of rheumatic diseases in the current COVID-19 pandemic situation."

Caractérisation de l’insuffisance rénale aiguë chez les patients de réanimation atteints du COVID-19,"Introduction La fréquence, la sévérité et la caractérisation de l’insuffisance rénale aiguë (l’IRA) n’avaient pas été décrites dans les formes les plus sévères de la maladie. Description Nous avons conduit une étude de cohorte observationnelle dans 4 services de réanimation du CHU de Bordeaux du 3 mars au 14 avril 2020. Tous les patients diagnostiqués positifs au COVID-19 et présentant des signes de gravité respiratoire (besoin de ≥4 L/min d’oxygène pour maintenir une SpO2 ≥94 %) ont été inclus. Méthodes L’IRA était définie selon les critères KDIGO (créatinine+diurèse). Une analyse urinaire systématique (incluant ionogramme urinaire, protéinurie et recherche de glycosurie, leucocyturie et hématurie) a été réalisée le jour de l’apparition de l’IRA. Une IRA transitoire a été définie comme un retour à la créatininémie basale ou une baisse de plus de 50 % de la créatininémie dans les 72heures après le diagnostic d’IRA. Résultats Trois cent quatre-vingt patients positifs au COVID-19 ont été admis au CHU de Bordeaux. Parmi eux, 45 (12 %) ont été admis en réanimation auxquels s’ajoutent 26 patients transférés d’autres régions de France. Sur les 71 patients inclus, une IRA a été diagnostiquée chez 57 (80 %) dont 20/57 patients avec une IRA stade 1, 20/57 stade 2 et 17/57 stade 3. Le suivi médian était de 17 [12–23] jours. Deux patients sont décédés dans les 72h et une IRA transitoire était présente chez 4/55 (7 %) patients. Les paramètres de l’ionogramme urinaire n’étaient pas différents entre les patients ayant une IRA transitoire ou non. L’épuration extrarénale a été nécessaire chez 10 patients. Le rapport protéinurie/créatininurie était de 82 [54–140] mg/mmol avec un ratio albuminurie/protéinurie à 0,23±20. Une glycosurie a été retrouvée chez 2 patients. Conclusion L’IRA associée aux formes sévères de COVID-19 est très fréquente, persistante, sévère et se présente sous la forme d’une atteinte tubulaire ou tubulo-interstitielle sans glycosurie."
Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis secondary to COVID‐19 infection: A case report,"We present a case of an 83‐year‐old woman with a history of hypertension, transient ischemic attack (TIA), atrial fibrillation, chronic renal impairment presented to our dermatology emergency room on April 9, 2020, for evaluation of purple palpable papules and serohaematic blisters on both her lower legs, feet and toes that had appeared 5 days earlier (Figure 1)."

Estimating the Cost of Industry Investment in Drug Research and Development: A Review of Methods and Results,"Research and development (R&D) costs factor into considerations of the tradeoffs between prices, intellectual property protection, and incentivizing innovation, all of which can have implications for policy development. Yet, there is little consensus on the actual cost of R&D for new drugs. We review and synthesize papers estimating drug R&D costs incurred by industry. We find a substantial range of per-drug costs, from $113 million to just over $6 billion in 2018 dollars. This range includes estimates covering all new drugs, new molecular entities, and drugs in specific therapeutic classes. The range is narrower—$318 million to $2.8 billion—for estimates of the per-drug cost for new molecular entities. We discuss the data sources, methods, and assumptions used in each study to provide context for the wide range in existing estimates. Differences in definitions, methods, and assumptions lead to large divergences in the main estimates, and the combination of fragmented data sources and different assumptions across studies means that the resulting estimates that can rarely be directly compared. We suggest areas for future research and data collection that would result in more comparable and robust estimates to inform ongoing policy discussion."

Human parainfluenza virus types 1–4 in hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory infections in China,"Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are an important cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs). HPIV‐4, a newly identified virus, has been associated with severe ALRTIs recently. A total of 771 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were collected from hospitalized children between March 2010 and February 2011. HPIVs were detected by Nest‐PCR, and other known respiratory viruses were detected by RT‐PCR and PCR. All amplification products were sequenced. HPIVs were detected in 151 (19.58%) patients, of whom 28 (3.63%) were positive for HPIV‐4, 12(1.55%) for HPIV‐1, 4 (0.51%) for HPIV‐2, and 107 (13.87%) for HPIV‐3. Only three were found to be co‐infected with different types of HPIVs. All HPIV‐positive children were under 5 years of age, with the majority being less than 1 year. Only the detection rate of HPIV‐3 had a significant statistical difference (χ(2) = 29.648, P = 0.000) between ages. HPIV‐3 and HPIV‐4 were detected during the summer. Sixty (39.74%) were co‐infected with other respiratory viruses, and human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most common co‐infecting virus. The most frequent clinical diagnosis was bronchopneumonia, and all patients had cough; some patients who were infected with HPIV‐3 and HPIV‐4 had polypnea and cyanosis. No significant difference was found in clinical manifestations between those who were infected with HPIV‐4 and HPIV‐3. Two genotypes for HPIV‐4 were prevalent, although HPIV‐4a dominated. HPIV‐4 is an important virus for children hospitalized with ALRTIs in China. HRV was the most common co‐infecting virus. Two genotypes for HPIV‐4 are prevalent, HPIV‐4a dominated. J. Med.

Acute respiratory infection and influenza‐like illness viral etiologies in Brazilian adults,"Influenza‐like illness (ILI) definitions have been used worldwide for influenza surveillance. These different case definitions can vary with regard to sensitivity and predictive values for laboratory confirmed influenza. The literature has indicated the inclusion of other viruses may be the cause of these variable results. The objective of the study was to evaluate ILI national sentinel criteria and viral etiologies in adults diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or ILI from 2001 to 2003 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were observed from 420 adults and collected on a daily basis from outpatient care units at University Hospital. The ILI definition included: fever plus at least one respiratory symptom (cough and/or sore throat) and one constitutional symptom (headache, malaise, myalgia, sweat or chills, or fatigue). DFA and RT‐PCR for influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were performed on nasal washes and 61.8% resulted positive. The respiratory viruses detected most often were influenza and rhinovirus. ILI was reported for 240/420 patients (57.1%), with influenza and rhinovirus etiologies accounting for 30.9% and 19.6%, respectively. Rhinovirus peak activity was concurrent with the influenza season. These findings highlight the implications of other viruses in ILI etiology and suggest that during the influenza season, this clinical overlap must be considered in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients.

Entry of Scotophilus Bat Coronavirus-512 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Human and Multiple Animal Cells,"Bats are natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Scotophilus bat CoV-512 demonstrates potential for cross-species transmission because its viral RNA and specific antibodies have been detected in three bat species of Taiwan. Understanding the cell tropism of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 is the first step for studying the mechanism of cross-species transmission. In this study, a lentivirus-based pseudovirus was produced using the spike (S) protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 or SARS-CoV as a surface protein to test the interaction between coronaviral S protein and its cell receptor on 11 different cells. Susceptible cells expressed red fluorescence protein (RFP) after the entry of RFP-bound green fluorescence protein (GFP)-fused S protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 (RFP-Sco-S-eGFP) or RFP-SARS-S pseudovirus, and firefly luciferase (FLuc) activity expressed by cells infected with FLuc-Sco-S-eGFP or FLuc-SARS-S pseudovirus was quantified. Scotophilus bat CoV-512 pseudovirus had significantly higher entry efficiencies in Madin Darby dog kidney epithelial cells (MDCK), black flying fox brain cells (Pabr), and rat small intestine epithelial cells (IEC-6). SARS-CoV pseudovirus had significantly higher entry efficiencies in human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (HEK-293T), pig kidney epithelial cells (PK15), and MDCK cells. These findings demonstrated that Scotophilus bat CoV-512 had a broad host range for cross-species transmission like SARS-CoV."

Effect of Face Masks on Interpersonal Communication During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Interpersonal communication has been severely affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Protective measures, such as social distancing and face masks, are essential to mitigate efforts against the virus, but pose challenges on daily face-to-face communication. Face masks, particularly, muffle sounds and cover facial expressions that ease comprehension during live communication. Here, we explore the role of facial expressions in communication and we highlight how the face mask can hinder interpersonal connection. In addition, we offer coping strategies and skills that can ease communication with face masks as we navigate the current and any future pandemic."
Myocarditis and intracardiac thrombus due to Henoch-Schönlein purpura: case report and literature review,"Cardiac involvement is very rare in patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). In this case study, we present an 8-year-old girl presenting with HSP-induced myocarditis and thrombus in the right atrium and HSP nephritis. To date, 15 cases of HSP-related cardiac involvement have been reported in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. These cases, together with our case, are included in this review. We excluded those patients with other rheumatologic diseases (acute rheumatic fever, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Kawasaki disease) accompanied by HSP. Three were children and 13 were adults and all were male except our case. This review revealed tachyarrhythmia, chest pain, dyspnea, murmur, and heart failure as the major signs. Cardiac tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), and imaging methods (echocardiography in all patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in three, cardiac biopsy in one, and post-mortem necropsy in three) showed that the cardiac involvements were pericardial effusion, intra-atrial thrombus, myocarditis, coronary artery changes, myocardial ischemia, infarction and necrosis, subendocardial hemorrhage, and left ventricular dilatation. Kidney involvement was not observed in three patients. As the treatment, high-dose prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, oral corticosteroid, azathioprine, nadroparin calcium, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, and diuretics were used. Eleven patients (all three children and eight of the adults) had a complete cardiac recovery. Cardiac involvement in adults was more likely to be fatal. Death (three patients), ischemia, and infarct have been reported only in adults. We suggested that early and aggressive treatment can be life-saving. MRI examination is effective at identifying cardiac involvement."
“We didn't get much schooling because we were fishing all the time”: Potential impacts of irregular school attendance on the spread of epidemics,"OBJECTIVES: Especially in traditional, rural, and low‐income areas, children attend school irregularly. School‐based interventions are common mitigation strategies for infectious disease epidemics, but if daily attendance is not the norm, the impact of schools on disease spread might be overestimated. METHODS: We use an agent‐based model of an early 20th century Newfoundland community to compare epidemic size and duration in three scenarios: (1) all school‐aged children attend school each weekday, (2) students aged 10–15 have a chance of engaging in adult activities each day, and (3) students aged 10–15 have a chance of being reassigned to adult roles at the start of each simulation and thus never attend school. RESULTS: As the probability of not attending school increases, epidemics become smaller and peak earlier. The change in final size is larger with permanent reassignment (35% at baseline, 18% at maximum reassignment) than with daily nonattendance (35% vs. 22%). For both scenarios, the peak occurs 3 days earlier with maximum absence compared to the baseline. Benefits extend beyond the reassigned agents, as all school‐aged agents are more likely to escape infection with increasing reassignment, and on average, 3–6 additional agents (2.6%–5.3%) escape infection compared to the baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that absenteeism can have important impacts on epidemic outcomes. Thus, socioeconomic and other reasons for nonattendance of school, as well as how rates vary in different contexts, must be considered in models predicting epidemic outcomes or evaluating public health interventions in the face of major pandemics."
Evaluation of the Thuringian Bovine Johne’s Disease Control Program—A Case Study,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Paratuberculosis, or Johne’s Disease, occurs worldwide, causing a granulomatous enteritis in ruminants. Control programs, which operate mainly on a voluntary basis, have been established in several regions. In Thuringia, a federal state of Germany, a voluntary control program was firstly established in 2003 and revised in 2008 and 2015. This study aimed at evaluating the results achieved in voluntary Johne’s Disease control in Thuringia between 2015 and 2020. By the end of 2020, a total of 67 dairy herds with approximately 33,000 dairy cows and 87 suckler herds keeping approximately 6000 cows of beef breeds were enrolled, representing 35% or 16% of the population, respectively. In affected herds, the program focused on prevalence reduction by hygienic measures to break the infection cycle, annual testing for the detection of animals shedding the infectious agent and culling of these animals. A certification pathway was established based on a testing period of 3 years without positive results, and 58 herds were certified as ‘non-suspect’ with respect to Johne’s Disease. Analyzing the annual calf mortality rate in enrolled dairy farms revealed that herds that had been certified as ‘non-suspect’ regarding Johne’s Disease had a lower calf mortality rate than herds that were not enrolled in the program. ABSTRACT: The Thuringian Johne’s Disease (JD) Control Program provides a voluntary approach to JD control in Thuringia, a federal state of Germany. The program has three objectives: reduce the level of infection when present; reduce the spread of JD to uninfected herds; and facilitate the certification and protection of herds that are non-suspect with respect to JD. The program offers pathways for the management of affected herds and for certification of herds with continuing negative tests. After the control stage (CS), a certification stage of at least 3 consecutive years with continuing negative results in the annual whole-herd test has to be passed until a herd can be certified as ‘non-suspect’ with respect to JD. This study focused on calf mortality in relation to JD herd status. In a longitudinal study, the association of annual calf mortality rate of a total of 93 dairy herds (13 ‘non-suspect’; 26 in control stage; 54 not enrolled) over 10 consecutive years with JD herd status was investigated using a generalized mixed linear model with repeated measures. Non-suspect herds had a lower calf mortality rate compared with other farms. We conclude that establishing JD control measures lowers the calf mortality rate."

Emotional consequences of COVID-19 home confinement: The ECLB-COVID19 multicenter study,"Abstract: Background: Public health recommendations and government measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have enforced restrictions on daily living, which may include social distancing, remote work/school, and home confinement. While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional well-being. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on mental wellbeing and mood and feelings questionnaires. Methods: The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the multi-languages survey through their networks to general society. Of the 64 questions, 7 were from the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), and 13 were from the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), which are both validated instruments. Results: Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p<0.001 and {Delta}%= 9.4 %) in the total score of mental wellbeing was noted. More individuals (+12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing during compared to before home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire (i.e., depressive symptoms) showed a significant increase by 44.9% (p<0.001) in total score with more people (+10%) developing depressive symptoms during compared to before home confinement. Conclusion: The ECLB-COVID19 survey revealed an increased psychosocial strain triggered by the enforced home confinement. To mitigate this high risk of mental disorders and to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL), a crisis-oriented interdisciplinary intervention is urgently needed."
Remote Monitoring of Patient Respiration with Mask Attachment -- A Pragmatic Solution for Medical Facilities,"Remote monitoring of vital signs in infectious patients minimizes the risks of viral transmissions to healthcare professionals. Evidence indicates that donning face masks reduces the risk of viral transmissions and is now the norm in medical facilities. We propose attaching an acoustic-sensing device onto face masks to assist medical facilities in monitoring patients' respiration remotely. Usability and functionality studies of the modified face mask were evaluated on 16 healthy participants, who were blindfolded throughout the data collection. Around half of the participants noticed the difference between the modified and unmodified masks but they also reported there was no discomfort in using the modified mask. Respiratory rates of the participants were evaluated for one minute and the mean error of respiratory rate was found to be 2.0 +/- 1.3 breath per minute. As all participants were healthy, the wheeze detection algorithm was assessed by playing 176 wheezes and 176 normal breaths through a foam mannequin. The recordings were played at three different times to account for varying environmental noise. The overall accuracy of the wheeze detection algorithm was 91.9%. The current findings support and suggest the use of the mask attachment in medical facilities."
"Cryptosporidium parvum and other enteric pathogens in scouring neonatal dairy calves from the Al Ain region, United Arab Emirates","Abstract Faecal specimens from 36 scouring neonatal calves from two dairy farms located in the Al Ain region of the UAE were screened with pathogen-specific antigen ELISA for Cryptosporidium parvum, Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, and coronavirus. Additionally, faecal smears were stained with modified-acid-fast for Cryptosporidium oocysts, and the VITEK 2 system plus Gram's stain used to identify bacteria isolated from the faecal samples. Farm management practices were also evaluated during a farm visit. Of the 36 calves, 29, 13, five, and six were positive for C. parvum, E. coli K99, bovine coronavirus, and rotavirus antigens respectively, while 27 were positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts. In various combinations, mixed infections were detected in 20/36 calves. This is the first report of C. parvum, E. coli K99, Salmonella spp., rotavirus, and coronavirus in ≤14-days-old scouring neonatal dairy calves from the UAE. Molecular characterization of these pathogens and nationwide epidemiological calf scour studies are recommended."
Inflight fiber printing toward array and 3D optoelectronic and sensing architectures,"Scalability and device integration have been prevailing issues limiting our ability in harnessing the potential of small-diameter conducting fibers. We report inflight fiber printing (iFP), a one-step process that integrates conducting fiber production and fiber-to-circuit connection. Inorganic (silver) or organic {PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate]} fibers with 1- to 3-μm diameters are fabricated, with the fiber arrays exhibiting more than 95% transmittance (350 to 750 nm). The high surface area–to–volume ratio, permissiveness, and transparency of the fiber arrays were exploited to construct sensing and optoelectronic architectures. We show the PEDOT:PSS fibers as a cell-interfaced impedimetric sensor, a three-dimensional (3D) moisture flow sensor, and noncontact, wearable/portable respiratory sensors. The capability to design suspended fibers, networks of homo cross-junctions and hetero cross-junctions, and coupling iFP fibers with 3D-printed parts paves the way to additive manufacturing of fiber-based 3D devices with multilatitude functions and superior spatiotemporal resolution, beyond conventional film-based device architectures."
RISK MITIGATION BEHAVIORS TO PREVENT INFECTION IN THE MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE COMMUNITY DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC,
Endothelial glycocalyx degradation and disease severity in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi malaria,"Degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx is associated with mortality in adult falciparum malaria. However, its role in the pathogenesis of non-falciparum malaria is unknown. In Malaysian patients with knowlesi (n = 200) and vivax (n = 61) malaria, and in healthy controls (n = 50), we measured glycocalyx breakdown products plasma syndecan-1 and urinary glycosaminoglycans, and evaluated correlations with biomarkers of disease severity. Urinary glycosaminoglycans were increased in patients with knowlesi and vivax malaria compared to healthy controls, and in knowlesi malaria were highest in those with severe disease. In knowlesi malaria, plasma syndecan-1 was also highest in those with severe disease, and correlated with markers of endothelial activation (angiopoietin-2, osteoprotegerin, ICAM-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and impaired microvascular reactivity. Syndecan-1 also correlated with endothelial activation (ICAM-1, angiopoietin-2) and ADMA in vivax malaria. In knowlesi malaria increased syndecan-1 was associated with acute kidney injury, after controlling for age and parasitemia. In knowlesi malaria, the difference in median syndecan-1 between severe and non-severe disease was more marked in females than males. Endothelial glycocalyx degradation is increased in knowlesi and vivax malaria, and associated with disease severity and acute kidney injury in knowlesi malaria. Agents that inhibit glycocalyx breakdown may represent adjunctive therapeutics for severe non-falciparum malaria."
Stable physical activity patterns predominate in a longitudinal study of physical activity among young adults in Canada from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic,"We examined change in walking, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and meeting MVPA guidelines from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identified factors associated with newly meeting and no longer meeting MVPA guidelines during the pandemic. Complete data were available for 614 young adults participating in the ongoing Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) study pre-pandemically in 2010–12 and 2017–20, and during the pandemic in 2020–21. Change in physical activity was examined in four sub-groups (i.e., stable inactive, newly met MVPA guidelines, no longer met MVPA guidelines, stable active). Factors associated with newly and no longer met MVPA guidelines were identified in multivariable logistic regression. While walking and MVPA changed little from 2010-2 to 2017–20, both declined during the pandemic (median for both = -30 min/week). 63.3% of participants reported no change in meeting MVPA guidelines during the pandemic, 11.4% newly met MVPA guidelines and 25.2% no longer met MVPA guidelines. Male sex, not university-educated, amotivated to engage in physical activity reported pre-pandemic, and endorsing physical activity as a COVID-19 coping strategy were associated with newly met MVPA guidelines. Male sex, not university-educated, higher problem-focused coping scores and endorsing physical activity as a COVID-19 coping strategy were protective of no longer met MVPA guidelines. Increased understanding of why some participants increased or decreased MVPA during the pandemic is needed to inform physical activity-related policy during pandemics."
COVID 19 and the Opioid Epidemic: An Analysis of Clinical Outcomes During COVID 19,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Here we aimed to characterize clinical outcomes in those receiving treatment at a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) methadone maintenance treatment program (MMT) during the COVID 19 pandemic in which SAMSHA regulations for MMTs were changed to provide a greater number of methadone allotments and decreased clinic-visit frequency. METHODS: We report results of a single-site, pre-post cohort study of urine drug screen data 3 months before and after an increase in allotments of take-home medication from the methadone clinic. One hundred twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria for this study. The study was reviewed by the NYHHS IRB committee and granted final approval by the Research and Development Committee. RESULTS: The sample was predominately male, average age 66years and average years in most recent treatment is 4.1 years. No statistical significance was found between period 1 and period 2 in the positive test detection for nonprescribed opiates, methadone and illicit substances (P > .05), number of new medical illnesses or overdoses. We controlled for participant age, substance use disorder diagnosis, psychiatric disorder diagnosis, and number of years in treatment. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study illustrate the relative safety of the changes made at this particular MMT during the pandemic. Additionally, there was continued adherence to methadone treatment with minimal change in illicit substance use during period 1 and period 2. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: To these authors’ knowledge this paper is one of the first to examine clinical outcomes in those with opioid addiction prescribed methadone from MMTs during the COVID 19 pandemic."
Immune Response in the Brain: Glial Response and Cytokine Production,"Abstract Although the brain has been considered as an immunologically privileged site, the evidence to date suggests that this is no longer the case. Cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-3 induce class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression on neural cells. IFN-γ, the most potent inducer of MHC antigen, also induces class II MHC antigen expression on microglia and astrocytes, which enable them to function as antigen-presenting cells. Thus, in some pathological conditions, invading T cells can interact with neural cells to induce central nervous system (CNS) damage. Glial cells have also been shown to produce various cytokines and chemokines. Almost all cytokines and chemokines known to occur in the immune system are also produced in the CNS. In this chapter, the glial responses contributing to neuroimmune interactions are reviewed, with a focus on production and functions of cytokines in the CNS."

Examining Public Sentiments and Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccination: Infoveillance Study Using Twitter Posts,"BACKGROUND: A global rollout of vaccinations is currently underway to mitigate and protect people from the COVID-19 pandemic. Several individuals have been using social media platforms such as Twitter as an outlet to express their feelings, concerns, and opinions about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination programs. This study examined COVID-19 vaccine–related tweets from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, to uncover the topics, themes, and variations in sentiments of public Twitter users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine key themes and topics from COVID-19 vaccine–related English tweets posted by individuals, and to explore the trends and variations in public opinions and sentiments. METHODS: We gathered and assessed a corpus of 2.94 million COVID-19 vaccine–related tweets made by 1.2 million individuals. We used CoreX topic modeling to explore the themes and topics underlying the tweets, and used VADER sentiment analysis to compute sentiment scores and examine weekly trends. We also performed qualitative content analysis of the top three topics pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Topic modeling yielded 16 topics that were grouped into 6 broader themes underlying the COVID-19 vaccination tweets. The most tweeted topic about COVID-19 vaccination was related to vaccination policy, specifically whether vaccines needed to be mandated or optional (13.94%), followed by vaccine hesitancy (12.63%) and postvaccination symptoms and effects (10.44%) Average compound sentiment scores were negative throughout the 16 weeks for the topics postvaccination symptoms and side effects and hoax/conspiracy. However, consistent positive sentiment scores were observed for the topics vaccination disclosure, vaccine efficacy, clinical trials and approvals, affordability, regulation, distribution and shortage, travel, appointment and scheduling, vaccination sites, advocacy, opinion leaders and endorsement, and gratitude toward health care workers. Reversal in sentiment scores in a few weeks was observed for the topics vaccination eligibility and hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of dominant themes, topics, sentiments, and changing trends about COVID-19 vaccination can aid governments and health care agencies to frame appropriate vaccination programs, policies, and rollouts."
Biological activity evaluations of chemical constituents derived from Mongolian medicinal forage plants and their applications in combating infectious diseases and addressing health problems in humans and livestock,"Mongolian nomadic people possess traditional knowledge of wild plants that grow in their areas of habitation. Many of these are forage plants in nature and are consumed by livestock. However, these plants are known to have medicinal and/or toxic properties. To establish a scientific understanding of the plants, and in turn, offer sound knowledge on their applications and effective use, it is essential to collect data pertaining to the chemical constituents of each plant. Therefore, the first objective of this study was to identify and determine the structural constituents of the forage plants that were available to our research group. Furthermore, in an attempt to demonstrate the biological activities of the isolated chemical compounds, we focused on solving some of the social issues affecting Mongolian communities, including protozoan diseases affecting livestock, vectors of infectious diseases, and the general health of humans and their livestock. The results of the chemical constituents derived from Mongolian medicinal plants and their biological activities that were studied in the recent decade are also described herein.

The effect of self-care counseling on health practices of adolescent pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and childbirth at an early age are associated with potential risks and complications for adolescent mothers. Health practices are behaviors that can positively affect maternal and fetal health. This study aimed to investigate the effects of self-care counseling on health practices (main outcome), attitudes towards motherhood and pregnancy, and pregnancy symptoms (secondary outcomes) in adolescent pregnant women. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 54 adolescent pregnant women admitted to the health centers of Bukan, Iran in 2020 were enrolled. Using randomized block design, the participants were randomly assigned to the counseling (n=27) and control (n=27) groups. Those in the intervention group attended 6 self-care group counseling sessions. The Health Practices Questionnaire-II (HPQ-II), Attitudes towards Motherhood and Pregnancy Questionnaire (PRE-MAMA), and Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI) were completed before and 4 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: Based on the results of ANCOVA with controlled baseline values, after the intervention the mean health practices score of the participants in the intervention group was significantly higher than those in the control group (adjusted mean difference (AMD): 36.34; 95% CI: 34.69 to 37.98; P<0.001). The mean attitude towards motherhood score of the participants in the intervention group was significantly higher than those in the control group (AMD: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.96; P= 0.038). However, the mean pregnancy symptoms score of the participants in the intervention group was partially lower than those in the control group (AMD: -1.37; 95% CI: -4.32 to 1.58; P= 0.354). CONCLUSION: Self-care counseling sessions can improve the health practices of adolescent pregnant women and enhance their attitudes towards maternal role and pregnancy. Therefore, planners are recommended to organize self-care counseling programs for all pregnant women, especially for adolescent pregnant women.

Airborne Spread of Coronavirus Disease-2019 and Its Implications for Nuclear Medicine Practice,
The Effect of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Melanoma Diagnosis in Italy,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to lockdowns for much of the world. In Italy, all health procedures not directly related to COVID-19 were reduced/suspended, thus limiting patient access to hospitals. Any delay in cancer treatment presents the additional risk of tumors progressing from being curable to becoming incurable. Specifically, melanoma survival rate strictly depends on tumor thickness which, in turn, is a function of time. To estimate the impact on melanoma progression of the reduction in the dermatologic services during the COVID-19 lockdown, a retrospective observational cohort study was conducted, designed to compare the clinical/histologic characteristics of the primary melanomas removed in the first two months after the end of the lockdown (May-July 2020) in twelve Italian centers characterized by different COVID-19 case frequencies. The control group was represented by the melanomas removed in the same period of the previous three years. Overall, 1,124 melanomas were considered: 237 as part of the study group and 887 from the control group (average 295), with a 20% reduction. Breslow thickness – as well as high-risk histotypes and melanomas with vertical growth – increased for all melanomas. Ulcerated and high mitotic index melanomas increased, particularly in northern Italy. In Italy, the lockdown led to a significant worsening of melanoma severity, determining a staging jump, with a consequent worsening of the outcomes."
Impact of COVID-19 on healthcare organisation and cancer outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Changes in the management of patients with cancer and delays in treatment delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the use of hospital resources and cancer mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient flows, patient pathways and use of hospital resources during the pandemic were simulated using a discrete event simulation model and patient-level data from a large French comprehensive cancer centre's discharge database, considering two scenarios of delays: massive return of patients from November 2020 (early-return) or March 2021 (late-return). Expected additional cancer deaths at 5 years and mortality rate were estimated using individual hazard ratios based on literature. RESULTS: The number of patients requiring hospital care during the simulation period was 13,000. In both scenarios, 6–8% of patients were estimated to present a delay of >2 months. The overall additional cancer deaths at 5 years were estimated at 88 in early-return and 145 in late-return scenario, with increased additional deaths estimated for sarcomas, gynaecological, liver, head and neck, breast cancer and acute leukaemia. This represents a relative additional cancer mortality rate at 5 years of 4.4 and 6.8% for patients expected in year 2020, 0.5 and 1.3% in 2021 and 0.5 and 0.5% in 2022 for each scenario, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-related diagnostic and treatment delays in patients with cancer are expected to impact patient survival. In the perspective of recurrent pandemics or alternative events requiring an intensive use of limited hospital resources, patients should be informed not to postpone care, and medical resources for patients with cancer should be sanctuarised."
Prioritizing people and rapid learning in times of crisis: A virtual learning initiative to support health workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic,"The Western Cape province was the early epicentre of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in South Africa and on the African continent. In this short article we report on an initiative set up within the provincial Department of Health early in the pandemic to facilitate collective learning and support for health workers and managers across the health system, emphasising the importance of leadership, systems resilience, nonhierarchical learning and connectedness. These strategies included regular and systematic engagement with organised labour, different ways of gauging and responding to staff morale, and daily ‘huddles’ for raid learning and responsive action. We propose three transformational actions that could deliver health systems that protect staff during good times and in times of system shocks. (a) Continuously invest in building the foundations of system resilience in good times, to draw on in an acute crisis situation. (b) Provide consistent leadership for an explicit commitment to supporting health workers through decisive action across the system. (c) Optimise available resources and partners, act on improvement ideas and obstacles. Build trusting relationships amongst and across actors."
Normal breathing releases SARS-CoV-2 into the air,"This study tests the release of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into the air during normal breathing, without any sign of possible risk of contagion such as coughing, sneezing or talking. Five patients underwent oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and salivary swabs for real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Direct SARS-CoV-2 release during normal breathing was also investigated by RT-PCR in air samples collected using a microbiological sampler. Viral RNA was detected in air at 1 cm from the mouth of patients whose oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and salivary swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In contrast, the viral RNA was not identified in the exhaled air from patients with oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and salivary swabs that tested negative. Contagion of SARS-CoV-2 is possible by being very close to the mouth of someone who is infected, asymptomatic and simply breathing."
The Covid-19 Pandemic Constraints May Lead to Disease Progression for Patients with Liver Cancer Scheduled to Receive Locoregional Therapies: Single-Centre Retrospective Analysis in an Interventional Radiology Unit,
Increase in Antibody Titers Following Sars-Cov-2 Vaccination Remains Limited for More Than 3 Years after Final Dose of Anti-CD20 Antibody,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic. Patients with hematological disorders are known to be at high risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been rapidly developed. Although mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are reported to be effective, efficacy in patients with hematological malignancies who have received anti-CD20 antibody treatment remains unclear. Here, we prospectively evaluated the efficacy of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with B-cell malignancies treated with anti-CD20 antibody. We first evaluated antibody titers in 12 healthy volunteers (median age 75.5 years, range 57-82) and three lymphoma patients undergoing R-CHOP therapy (73, 81, and 81 years old) who had received 2 vaccine doses of BNT162b2 at pre-vaccination, 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose of vaccination. IgG antibody titers for S1 protein were measured in serum samples by ELISA. In healthy control subjects, titers were clearly increased. In contrast, no patient treated with R-CHOP developed antibodies even after the second vaccination (Figure A). To determine the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell reactivity in these three patients, we evaluated interferon (IFN)-γ response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide before and after the second vaccination dose, and detected IFN-γ responses after vaccination in all three patients (Figure B). Next, to investigate the duration of the effect of anti-CD20 antibody on antibody production to BNT162b2, we enrolled 36 patients (median age 74 years, range 50-87) who had received the final dose of anti-CD20 antibody 48-1320 (median 571) days before vaccination. S1 antibody titers were measured 14 days after the second dose of vaccination. Diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 21), follicular lymphoma (n = 9), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (n = 3), and mantle cell lymphoma (n = 3). Thirty-four patients had received rituximab-based and 2 had received obinutuzumab-based therapy, with a median of 6 (range 3-20) courses. No patient had received any chemotherapy after the last anti-CD20 antibody dose. No patient vaccinated within close to one year or sooner after the last anti-CD20 antibody administration showed an increase in titers. Furthermore, titers in most patients were lower than in healthy volunteers even among those vaccinated more than three years after the last administration (Figure C). Finally, we investigated surrogate markers of antibody production ability. We found no relationship between the percent of B-cells (CD19-positive cells) and S1 antibody titers (Figure D), whereas all patients (n = 9) with total IgG level below lower normal limit (< 870 mg/dl) had low S1 antibody titers (< 0.16), below the lowest optical density (O.D.) value in healthy donors (Figure E). These findings indicate that the antibody-mediated response to vaccination in patients following treatment with anti-CD20 antibody was considerably impaired for an extended time. Alternative protection strategies for these patients are therefore warranted. Although T-cell responses were detected, we recommend that these patients continue to wear a face mask and wash their hands to prevent COVID-19 even after vaccination.

COVID-19 Inspired Relational Telemental Health Services for Incarcerated Individuals and Their Families,"The novel coronavirus pandemic has caused marriage and family therapists (MFTs) to alter how they provide clinical services. MFTs must determine how to deliver relationship-oriented services to underserved populations that are often forgotten during crises, including incarcerated individuals and their families. The primary purpose of this paper is to showcase how relational telemental health (TMH) services for incarcerated individuals and their families can increase access to services and improve relational health. Information is presented about corrections in the U.S., effects of incarceration on partners, children, and other family members, the behavioral health and relationship needs of incarcerated individuals, and current approaches to relational mental health and telehealth in corrections. Finally, suggestions are offered on how relational TMH could be used in corrections during the COVID-19 pandemic, including advocacy for collaborative healthcare, recommended implementation practices, and ethical considerations."
Efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation based on glycyrrhizic acid in a challenge study of white spot syndrome in white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei),"There is a lack of preventive and therapeutic drug-based treatments for the shrimp viral disease known as white spot syndrome (WSSV). Thus a challenge study inducing WSSV in juvenile white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was established, setting 4 groups: challenged — not treated and unchallenged, untreated control groups and two experimental ones (E1 and E2) both treated with diammonium glycyrrhizic acid, extracted from licorice with added vitamins and oligoelements, and as in-feed medication. Group E1 received diammonium glycyrrhizic acid included in their daily feed, starting 17 days before challenge with WSSV and maintaining the treatment for further 5 days after the end of the trial, which was set on day 18. Group E2 received this medication as group E1 throughout the trial, but starting 1 day before the challenge with WSSV. The group with highest surviving median values was E1, amounting two times the survival median in comparison with the control groups (P = 0.007). Also a statistical difference was found in terms of survival means in favor of group E1 as compared to group E2. Macroscopic and histopathological findings revealed lesions compatible with WSSV and similar mortality in the challenged untreated group. These findings were highly reduced or inexistent in mortality analyzed from groups E1 as well as in the unchallenged — untreated control group and greatly reduced in group E2. Considering the apparent high efficacy observed and that glycyrrhizic acid and mineral and vitamin components added as treatment, and taking as an advantage that this preparation has been regarded as nutraceuticals, it is here proposed that large scale trials should be conducted to evaluate the effects here observed in commercial and larger scale shrimp farms."

Shifting Epidemiology of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Far Eastern and Southeast Asian Patients: Explanations and Implications,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Liver cancer is a major health burden globally with high rates in the Far East and Southeast Asia. Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus remain the major causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide; however, the epidemiology is changing. Here, we review the changing epidemiological changes among Far East and Southeast Asians and among Asian Americans in the USA. RECENT FINDINGS: HBV- and HCV-induced HCC is anticipated to decline in incidence. In contrast, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-induced HCC will outrank viral hepatitis in the next decade. Alcoholic liver disease will remain a persistent risk factor for HCC. These epidemiological shifts might have implications for the care of patients with HCC as described in this review. Societal changes are impacting the global incidence of HCC and will likely also impact the care of patients with this malignancy."
Reducing readmission rates for individuals discharged from acute psychiatric care in Alberta using peer and text message support: Protocol for an innovative supportive program,"BACKGROUND: Individuals discharged from inpatient psychiatry units have the highest readmission rates of all hospitalized patients. These readmissions are often due to unmet need for mental health care compounded by limited human resources. Reducing the need for hospital admissions by providing alternative effective care will mitigate the strain on the healthcare system and for people with mental illnesses and their relatives. We propose implementation and evaluation of an innovative program which augments Mental Health Peer Support with an evidence-based supportive text messaging program developed using the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. METHODS: A pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial, where daily supportive text messages (Text4Support) and mental health peer support are the interventions, will be employed. We anticipate recruiting 10,000 participants at the point of their discharge from 9 acute care psychiatry sites and day hospitals across four cities in Alberta. The primary outcome measure will be the number of psychiatric readmissions within 30 days of discharge. We will also evaluate implementation outcomes such as reach, acceptability, fidelity, and sustainability. Our study will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, and the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance framework. Data will be extracted from administrative data, surveys, and qualitative methods. Quantitative data will be analysed using machine learning. Qualitative interviews will be transcribed and analyzed thematically using both inductive and deductive approaches. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this will be the first large-scale clinical trial to assess the impact of a daily supportive text message program with and without mental health peer support for individuals discharged from acute psychiatric care. We anticipate that the interventions will generate significant cost-savings by reducing readmissions, while improving access to quality community mental healthcare and reducing demand for acute care. It is envisaged that the results will shed light on the effectiveness, as well as contextual barriers and facilitators to implementation of automated supportive text message and mental health peer support interventions to reduce the psychological treatment and support gap for patients who have been discharged from acute psychiatric care.

"A Novel Model for Simulating COVID-19 Dynamics Through Layered Infection States that Integrate Concepts from Epidemiology, Biophysics and Medicine: SEI3R2S-Nrec","Introduction. Effectively modeling SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 dynamics requires careful integration of population health (public health motivation) and recovery dynamics (medical interventions motivation). This manuscript proposes a minimal pandemic model, which conceptually separates complex adaptive systems (CAS) associated with social behavior and infrastructure (e.g., tractable input events modulating exposure) from idealized bio-CAS (e.g., the immune system). The proposed model structure extends the classic simple SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, resistant/recovered) uni-causal compartmental model, widely used in epidemiology, into an 8th-order functional network SEI3R2S-Nrec model structure, with infection partitioned into three severity states (e.g., starts in I1, mostly asymptomatic, then I2 if notable symptoms, then I3 if should be hospitalized) connecting via a lattice of paths to two flux-partitioned resistant (R) states. Here Nrec (not recovered) represents a placeholder for better tying emerging SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 medical research findings with those from epidemiology. This is viewed as the minimal model that could be applicable to both a population (public health motivation) and to recovery dynamics (medical interventions motivation). Methods. Borrowing from fuzzy logic, a given model represents a Universe of Discourse (UoD) that is based on assumptions. Nonlinear flux rates are implemented using the classic Hill function, widely used in the biochemical and pharmaceutical fields and intuitive for inclusion within differential equations. There is support for encounter input events that modulate ongoing E (exposures) fluxes via S>I1 and other I1/2/3 encounters, partitioned into a social/group (uSG(t)) behavioral subgroup (e.g., ideally using evolving science best-practices), and a smaller uTB(t) subgroup with added spreader lifestyle and event support. In addition to signal and flux trajectories (e.g., plotted over 300 days), key cumulative output metrics are calculated (e.g., for fluxes such as I3>D deaths, I1>I2 cases and I2>I3 hospital admittances). The model is available for use; an interactive web-based version will follow. Results. Default population results are provided for the USA as a whole, for three states in which this author has lived (Arizona, Wisconsin, Oregon), and for several special hypothetical cases of idealized UoDs (e.g., nursing home; healthy low-risk mostly on I1>R1 path, demonstrating reinfections). Often known events were included (e.g., pulses for holiday weekends and election; Trump/governor-inspired summer outbreak in Arizona). Runs were mildly tuned by the author, in two stages: i) mild model-tuning (e.g., for obesity), then ii) iterative input tuning to obtain similar overall March-thru-November curve shapes and appropriate cumulative numbers for cases (lower than I1>I2 flux), hospitalizations (~I3) and deaths (I3>D flux). Both curve shapes and cumulative metrics are consistent with available data and could be further refined by groups with more resources (human, computational, data access). It is hoped that its causal predictions might prove helpful, with the starter models offered to policymakers, medical professionals, and on the ground managers of science-based interventions. Discussion and Future Directions. These include: i) the sensitivity of the model and inputs; ii) possible next steps for this SEI3R2S-Nrec framework that may include treating key compartments as dynamic sub-model clusters, to better address compartment-specific forms of population diversity (an extension that bears similarity to how biochemical reaction dynamics can occur within compartments, here for E [host-parasite biophysics], I [infection diversity], and/or R [immune diversity]); iii) the models potential utility as a framework for applying optimal/feedback control engineering to help manage the ongoing pandemic response in the context of competing subcriteria that must evolve with new tools (e.g., more testing, vaccines with temporary immunity); and iv) ways in which the Nrec medical submodel could be expanded to provide refined estimates of the types of tissue damage, impairments and dysfunction that are known byproducts of the COVID-19 disease process."

Enhancing sensitivity of lateral flow assay with application to SARS-CoV-2,"Lateral flow assay (LFA) has long been used as a biomarker detection technique. It has advantages such as low cost, rapid readout, portability, and ease of use. However, its qualitative readout process and lack of sensitivity are limiting factors. We report a photon-counting approach to accurately quantify LFAs while enhancing sensitivity. In particular, we demonstrate that the density of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be quantified and measured with an enhanced sensitivity using this simple laser optical analysis."
Efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID‐19: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"The purpose of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to examine clinical outcomes associated with convalescent plasma therapy in COVID‐19 patients. We performed a literature search on PubMed, medRxiv, Web of Science, and Scopus to identify studies published up to December 10th, 2020 that examined the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment for COVID‐19. The primary endpoints were mortality, clinical improvement, and hospital length of stay. We screened 859 studies that met the search criteria, performed full‐text reviews of 56 articles, and identified 15 articles that fulfilled inclusion criteria for meta‐analysis. The odds of mortality were significantly lower in the convalescent plasma group compared to the control group (OR = 0.59 [95% CI = 0.44; 0.78], P < .001), although results from two key randomized controlled trials did not support the mortality benefit. The odds of clinical improvement were significantly higher in the convalescent plasma group compared to the control group (OR = 2.02 [95% CI = 1.54; 2.65], P < .001). There was no difference in hospital length of stay between the convalescent plasma group and the control group (MD = −0.49 days [95% CI = −3.11; 2.12], P = .713). In all, these data indicate that a mortality benefit with convalescent plasma is unclear, although there remain benefits with convalescent plasma therapy for COVID‐19."
Conjugating immunoassays to mass spectrometry: solutions to contemporary challenges in clinical diagnostics,"Developments in immunoassays and mass spectrometry have independently influenced diagnostic technology. However, both techniques possess unique strengths and limitations, which define their ability to meet evolving requirements for faster, more affordable and more accurate clinical tests. In response, hybrid techniques, which combine the accessibility and ease-of-use of immunoassays with the sensitivity, high throughput and multiplexing capabilities of mass spectrometry are continually being explored. Developments in antibody conjugation methodology have expanded the role of these biomolecules to applications outside of conventional colorimetric assays and histology. Furthermore, the range of different mass spectrometry ionisation and analysis technologies has enabled its successful adaptation as a detection method for numerous clinically relevant immunological assays. Several recent examples of combined mass spectrometry-immunoassay techniques demonstrate the potential of these methods as improved diagnostic tests for several important human diseases. The present challenges are to continue technological advancements in mass spectrometry instrumentation and develop improved bioconjugation methods, which can overcome their existing limitations and demonstrate the clinical significance of these hybrid approaches."
Novel dynamic residue network analysis approaches to study allosteric modulation: SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and its evolutionary mutations as a case study,"The rational search for allosteric modulators and the allosteric mechanisms of these modulators in the presence of mutations is a relatively unexplored field. Here, we established novel in silico approaches and applied them to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) as a case study. First, we identified six potential allosteric modulators. Then, we focused on understanding the allosteric effects of these modulators on each of its protomers. We introduced a new combinatorial approach and dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis algorithms to examine patterns of change and conservation of critical nodes, according to five independent criteria of network centrality. We observed highly conserved network hubs for each averaged DRN metric on the basis of their existence in both protomers in the absence and presence of all ligands (persistent hubs). We also detected ligand specific signal changes. Using eigencentrality (EC) persistent hubs and ligand introduced hubs we identified a residue communication path connecting the allosteric binding site to the catalytic site. Finally, we examined the effects of the mutations on the behavior of the protein in the presence of selected potential allosteric modulators and investigated the ligand stability. One crucial outcome was to show that EC centrality hubs form an allosteric communication path between the allosteric ligand binding site to the active site going through the interface residues of domains I and II; and this path was either weakened or lost in the presence of some of the mutations. Overall, the results revealed crucial aspects that need to be considered in rational computational drug discovery."
COVID-19 and epilepsy./ Covid-19 og epilepsi,"Can COVID-19 cause epilepsy, or increase the tendency to seizures in those with epilepsy? Is it safe for persons with epilepsy to be vaccinated against COVID-19?"
"COVID-19 detection in cough, breath and speech using deep transfer learning and bottleneck features","We present an experimental investigation into the effectiveness of transfer learning and bottleneck feature extraction in detecting COVID-19 from audio recordings of cough, breath and speech. This type of screening is non-contact, does not require specialist medical expertise or laboratory facilities and can be deployed on inexpensive consumer hardware such as a smartphone. We use datasets that contain cough, sneeze, speech and other noises, but do not contain COVID-19 labels, to pre-train three deep neural networks: a CNN, an LSTM and a Resnet50. These pre-trained networks are subsequently either fine-tuned using smaller datasets of coughing with COVID-19 labels in the process of transfer learning, or are used as bottleneck feature extractors. Results show that a Resnet50 classifier trained by this transfer learning process delivers optimal or near-optimal performance across all datasets achieving areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98, 0.94 and 0.92 respectively for all three sound classes: coughs, breaths and speech. This indicates that coughs carry the strongest COVID-19 signature, followed by breath and speech. Our results also show that applying transfer learning and extracting bottleneck features using the larger datasets without COVID-19 labels led not only to improved performance, but also to a marked reduction in the standard deviation of the classifier AUCs measured over the outer folds during nested cross-validation, indicating better generalisation. We conclude that deep transfer learning and bottleneck feature extraction can improve COVID-19 cough, breath and speech audio classification, yielding automatic COVID-19 detection with a better and more consistent overall performance."
"Coronaviruses Induce Entry-Independent, Continuous Macropinocytosis","Macropinocytosis is exploited by many pathogens for entry into cells. Coronaviruses (CoVs) such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV are important human pathogens; however, macropinocytosis during CoV infection has not been investigated. We demonstrate that the CoVs SARS CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) induce macropinocytosis, which occurs late during infection, is continuous, and is not associated with virus entry. MHV-induced macropinocytosis results in vesicle internalization, as well as extended filopodia capable of fusing with distant cells. MHV-induced macropinocytosis requires fusogenic spike protein on the cell surface and is dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor activation. Inhibition of macropinocytosis reduces supernatant viral titers and syncytia but not intracellular virus titers. These results indicate that macropinocytosis likely facilitates CoV infection through enhanced cell-to-cell spreading. Our studies are the first to demonstrate virus use of macropinocytosis for a role other than entry and suggest a much broader potential exploitation of macropinocytosis in virus replication and host interactions."
SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination During Pregnancy: A Complex Decision,"As the first Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines passed United Kingdom and United States regulatory milestones in late 2020 and early 2021, multiple professional societies offered recommendations to assist pregnant and breastfeeding people as they choose whether to undergo vaccination. Despite such guidance, the lack of data describing vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in pregnant and breastfeeding people has made this decision challenging for many. However, even considering the paucity of data, the known risks of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy likely outweigh the not yet fully elucidated risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which have reassuring safety and efficacy profiles among non-pregnant people."
Muscle involvement in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic several reports indicated neurological involvement in COVID‐19 disease. Muscle involvement has also been reported as evidenced by creatine kinase (CK) elevations and reports of myalgia. METHODS: CK, markers of inflammation, pre‐existing diseases and statin use were extracted from records of Austrian hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. Disease severity was classified as severe in case of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or mortality. COVID‐19 patients were additionally compared to a historical group of hospitalized influenza patients. RESULTS: 351 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 and 258 with influenza were included in the final analysis. CK was elevated in 27% of COVID‐19 and in 28% of influenza patients. CK was higher in severe COVID‐19 as were markers of inflammation. CK correlated significantly with inflammation markers, which had an independent impact on CK when adjusted for demographic variables and disease severity. Compared to influenza patients, COVID‐19 patients were older, more frequent male, had more comorbidities and more frequently a severe disease course. Nevertheless, influenza patients had higher baseline CK than COVID‐19, and 35.7% of ICU admitted patients had CK levels > 1000 U/l compared to only 4.7% of ICU‐admitted COVID‐19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: HyperCKemia occurs in a similar frequency in COVID‐19 and influenza infection. CK levels were lower in COVID‐19 than in influenza in mild and severe disease. CK levels strongly correlate with disease severity and markers of inflammation. To date it remains unclear whether hyperCKemia is due to a virus‐triggered inflammatory response or direct muscle toxicity."
Fundamental Concepts of Human Thermoregulation and Adaptation to Heat: A Review in the Context of Global Warming,"The international community has recognized global warming as an impending catastrophe that poses significant threat to life on earth. In response, the signatories of the Paris Agreement (2015) have committed to limit the increase in global mean temperature to <1.5 °C from pre-industry period, which is defined as 1850–1890. Considering that the protection of human life is a central focus in the Paris Agreement, the naturally endowed properties of the human body to protect itself from environmental extremes should form the core of an integrated and multifaceted solution against global warming. Scholars believe that heat and thermoregulation played important roles in the evolution of life and continue to be a central mechanism that allows humans to explore, labor and live in extreme conditions. However, the international effort against global warming has focused primarily on protecting the environment and on the reduction of greenhouse gases by changing human behavior, industrial practices and government policies, with limited consideration given to the nature and design of the human thermoregulatory system. Global warming is projected to challenge the limits of human thermoregulation, which can be enhanced by complementing innate human thermo-plasticity with the appropriate behavioral changes and technological innovations. Therefore, the primary aim of this review is to discuss the fundamental concepts and physiology of human thermoregulation as the underlying bases for human adaptation to global warming. Potential strategies to extend human tolerance against environmental heat through behavioral adaptations and technological innovations will also be discussed. An important behavioral adaptation postulated by this review is that sleep/wake cycles would gravitate towards a sub-nocturnal pattern, especially for outdoor activities, to avoid the heat in the day. Technologically, the current concept of air conditioning the space in the room would likely steer towards the concept of targeted body surface cooling. The current review was conducted using materials that were derived from PubMed search engine and the personal library of the author. The PubMed search was conducted using combinations of keywords that are related to the theme and topics in the respective sections of the review. The final set of articles selected were considered “state of the art,” based on their contributions to the strength of scientific evidence and novelty in the domain knowledge on human thermoregulation and global warming."
Continuous Glucose Monitoring in the Hospital,"Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have suddenly become part of routine care in many hospitals. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated the use of new technologies and new processes to care for hospitalized patients, including diabetes patients. The use of CGMs to automatically and remotely supplement or replace assisted monitoring of blood glucose by bedside nurses can decrease: the amount of necessary nursing exposure to COVID-19 patients with diabetes; the amount of time required for obtaining blood glucose measurements, and the amount of personal protective equipment necessary for interacting with patients during the blood glucose testing. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now exercising enforcement discretion and not objecting to certain factory-calibrated CGMs being used in a hospital setting, both to facilitate patient care and to obtain performance data that can be used for future regulatory submissions. CGMs can be used in the hospital to decrease the frequency of fingerstick point of care capillary blood glucose testing, decrease hyperglycemic episodes, and decrease hypoglycemic episodes. Most of the research on CGMs in the hospital has focused on their accuracy and only recently outcomes data has been reported. A hospital CGM program requires cooperation of physicians, bedside nurses, diabetes educators, and hospital administrators to appropriately select and manage patients. Processes for collecting, reviewing, storing, and responding to CGM data must be established for such a program to be successful. CGM technology is advancing and we expect that CGMs will be increasingly used in the hospital for patients with diabetes."
Metaproteomic Profile of the Colonic Luminal Microbiota From Patients With Colon Cancer,"Recent studies have provided evidence of interactions among the gut microbiota (GM), local host immune cells, and intestinal tissues in colon carcinogenesis. However, little is known regarding the functions exerted by the GM in colon cancer (CC), particularly with respect to tumor clinical classification and lymphocyte infiltration. In addition, stool, usually employed as a proxy of the GM, cannot fully represent the original complexity of CC microenvironment. Here, we present a pilot study aimed at characterizing the metaproteome of CC-associated colonic luminal contents and identifying its possible associations with CC clinicopathological features. Colonic luminal contents were collected from 24 CC tissue specimens immediately after surgery. Samples were analyzed by shotgun metaproteomics. Almost 30,000 microbial peptides were quantified in the samples, enabling the achievement of the taxonomic and functional profile of the tumor-associated colonic luminal metaproteome. Upon sample aggregation based on tumor stage, grade, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), peptide sets enabling discrimination of sample groups were identified through discriminant analysis (DA). As a result, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides fragilis were significantly enriched in high-stage and high-grade CC, respectively. Among metabolic functions, formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase was significantly associated with high-stage CC. Finally, based on the results of this pilot study, we assessed the optimal sample size for differential metaproteomic studies analyzing colonic luminal contents. In conclusion, we provide a detailed picture of the microbial and host components of the colonic luminal proteome and propose promising associations between GM taxonomic/functional features and CC clinicopathological features. Future studies will be needed to verify the prognostic value of these data and to fully exploit the potential of metaproteomics in enhancing our knowledge concerning CC progression."
Predict Score: A New Biological and Clinical Tool to Help Predict Risk of Intensive Care Transfer for COVID-19 Patients,"Background: The COVID-19 crisis has strained world health care systems. This study aimed to develop an innovative prediction score using clinical and biological parameters (PREDICT score) to anticipate the need of intensive care of COVID-19 patients already hospitalized in standard medical units. Methods: PREDICT score was based on a training cohort and a validation cohort retrospectively recruited in 2020 in the Marseille University Hospital. Multivariate analyses were performed, including clinical, and biological parameters, comparing a baseline group composed of COVID-19 patients exclusively treated in standard medical units to COVID-19 patients that needed intensive care during their hospitalization. Results: Independent variables included in the PREDICT score were: age, Body Mass Index, Respiratory Rate, oxygen saturation, C-reactive protein, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and lactate dehydrogenase. The PREDICT score was able to correctly identify more than 83% of patients that needed intensive care after at least 1 day of standard medical hospitalization. Conclusions: The PREDICT score is a powerful tool for anticipating the intensive care need for COVID-19 patients already hospitalized in a standard medical unit. It shows limitations for patients who immediately need intensive care, but it draws attention to patients who have an important risk of needing intensive care after at least one day of hospitalization."
Pyrolyzed biowastes deactivated potentially toxic metals and eliminated antibiotic resistant genes for healthy vegetable production,"Potentially toxic metals (PTEs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) present in bio-wastes were the major environmental and health risks for soil use. If pyrolyzing bio-wastes into biochar could minimize such risks had not been elucidated. This study evaluated PTE pools, microbial and ARGs abundances of wheat straw (WS), swine manure (SM) and sewage sludge (SS) before and after pyrolysis, which were again tested for soil amendment at a 2% dosage in a pot experiment with a vegetable crop of pak choi (Brassica campestris L.). Pyrolysis led to PTEs concentration in biochars but reduced greatly their mobility, availability and migration potential, as revealed respectively by leaching, CaCl(2) extraction and risk assessment coding. In SM and SS after pyrolysis, gene abundance was removed by 4 to 5 orders for bacterial, by 2-3 orders for fungi and by 3-5 orders for total ARGs. With these material amended, PTEs available pool decreased by 25% to 85% while all ARGs eliminated to background in the pot soil. Unlike a >50% yield decrease and a >30% quality decline with unpyrolyzed SM and SS, their biochars significantly (p>0.05) increased biomass production and overall quality of pak choi grown in the amended soil. Comparatively, amendment of the biochars decreased plant PTEs content by 23-57% and greatly reduced health risk of pak choi, with total target hazard quotient values well below the guideline limit for subsistence diet by adult. Furthermore, biochar soil amendment enabled a synergic improvement on soil fertility, product quality, and biomass production as well as metal stabilization in the soil-plant system. Thus, biowastes pyrolysis and reuse in vegetable production could help build up a closed loop of production-waste-biochar-production, addressing not only circular economy but healthy food and climate nexus also and contributing to achieving the United Nations sustainable development goals."
RNA interference against viruses: strike and counterstrike,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved sequence-specific, gene-silencing mechanism that is induced by double-stranded RNA. RNAi holds great promise as a novel nucleic acid–based therapeutic against a wide variety of diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases and genetic disorders. Antiviral RNAi strategies have received much attention and several compounds are currently being tested in clinical trials. Although induced RNAi is able to trigger profound and specific inhibition of virus replication, it is becoming clear that RNAi therapeutics are not as straightforward as we had initially hoped. Difficulties concerning toxicity and delivery to the right cells that earlier hampered the development of antisense-based therapeutics may also apply to RNAi. In addition, there are indications that viruses have evolved ways to escape from RNAi. Proper consideration of all of these issues will be necessary in the design of RNAi-based therapeutics for successful clinical intervention of human pathogenic viruses."
Psychosocial consequences of infectious diseases,"Historically, there has been an exaggerated fear related to infection compared to other conditions. Infection possesses unique characteristics that account for this disproportionate degree of fear: it is transmitted rapidly and invisibly; historically, it has accounted for major morbidity and mortality; old forms re-emerge and new forms emerge; and both the media and society are often in awe. Because, in an outbreak, the patient is both a victim and a vector, and because there exists the potential for infringement of personal rights in order to control an outbreak, infection may be viewed (and has been depicted in popular culture) as a foreign invasion. During recent outbreaks, fear, denial, stigmatization and loss have been recorded in the implicated individuals. Stigmatization and discrimination may further involve ethical correlations, and attempts to adress these issues through activism may also have unwarranted effects. Public health initiatives can address the public's fears by increasing health literacy, which can contribute to reducing stigmatization."
A Novel Three-Dimensional Robot Arm Steered Camera for Ear Surgery.,"ABSTRACT Ear surgery requires magnified imaging of anatomical structures from its beginning to achieve safe and successful surgical outcomes. The historical evolution of magnification in otology has developed from monocular to binocular, and to three-dimensional and even to digital in modern times. Current technological advancements pursue high-quality visualization for the best surgical outcomes but also ergonomic for surgeons. Here, we evaluated the usability of such new technology in common otological surgeries like cochlear implantation and stapedectomy for the first time in patients. A three-dimensional camera mounted to a robot arm has hands-free control by goggles worn by the surgeon on a head mount. The camera at a distance of the patients but can also be draped in a sterile way that it forms a barrier tent between patient and surgical personnel in the theatre. The main reason to evaluate the feasibility of this new exoscope was driven by COVID-19 obligate measures for elective surgery such as hearing restoration. This new technology can be considered an important advantage for the surgeons working in microsurgery to perform their elective operations without aerosolization of the drill rinsing water possibly containing contaminated tissue. From a subjective point of view, the image quality is equivalent to conventional microscopes to provide safe otologic surgery."
"Migration of fully covered self-expandable metallic stents used to treat anastomotic strictures after orthotopic liver transplantation: A single-center, retrospective analysis","Insertion of a fully covered self-expandable metallic stent (FCEM) through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is an effective solution for biliary anastomotic stricture following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). However, FCEM migration continues to plague patients. This study aimed to evaluate the FCEM migration rate in our center, and to investigate the factors increasing the migration risk for FCEM. The study enrolled 43 post-OLT patients with confirmed duct-to-duct AS. The effects of age, gender, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ABO (blood group system consists of four antigens) incompatibility, stricture length, FCEM brand, FCEM length, donor liver and recipient bile duct diameters, size mismatches between the donor and recipient bile ducts >2 mm, diabetes and/or hypertension status, endoscopic sphincterotomy status, the use of plastic stents or nasobiliary drainage prior to FCEM implantation, duration from OLT to FCEM placement, and OLT etiology on FCEM migration were retrospectively analyzed. The FCEM migration rate was 48.8% (21/43) at 6 months. The serum AST level was significantly higher in the migration group than that in the nonmigration group (52.48 vs 29.50 U/L, P < .05). A lower serum AST level was associated with a decreased risk of FCEM migration in post-OLT patients with duct-to-duct anastomotic stricture (hazard ratio = 0.968, 95% confidence interval: 0.940–0.996, P = .028). In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, we showed that an elevated serum AST level was a potential risk factor for FCEM migration."
Retrospective Analysis of Inflammatory Markers and Patient Characteristics in Hospitalized Covid-19 Patients: An Early Experience in Louisiana,"Background The community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was detected in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in March 2020. Several previous studies have reported elevations of inflammatory markers in Covid-19 positive patients and suggested a possible correlation to disease severity. Methods We identified 69 patients from Baton Rouge General (BRG) Hospital who were admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and laboratory confirmed positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 13 and April 5, 2020. Demographic and laboratory data were obtained through a review of medical records. Statistical analysis was performed on several inflammatory markers in association with clinical disease severity. Results We identified 69 patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 65±14 years, 68% were male and 32% were female. A total of 13 patients (19%) were considered to have mild disease, 25 (36%) had moderate disease, and 31 (45%) were considered to have severe disease. A total of nine patients died (13%), 25 (36%) have been discharged from the hospital, 20 (29%) remain in the ICU, and 15 (22%) remain admitted to the hospital at the time of writing. Lymphopenia was common among hospitalized patients (39%) and was found to be statistically more pronounced in patients with severe disease (p<0.05). Inflammatory marker elevations were also seen in several patients, with statistically significant elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p <0.05). We found no statistically significant associations between ferritin, D-dimer, troponin I, body mass index (BMI), or creatine kinase (CK) with disease severity. Conclusions During the first three weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the most common reason for admission amongst Covid-19 positive patients was acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Previously, several studies have suggested a correlation between elevated inflammatory markers and disease severity. The presence of lymphopenia and elevations of CRP and LDH may be helpful in the risk stratification of these patients. In an effort to guide clinical decision making and provide insight into disease severity, further characterization of Covid-19 infection in hospitalized patients is urgently needed."
Surgery Provider Perceptions on Telehealth Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Room for Improvement,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has mandated rapid adoption of telehealth for surgical care. However, many surgical providers may be unfamiliar with telehealth. This study evaluates the perspectives of surgical providers practicing telehealth care during COVID-19 to help identify targets for surgical telehealth optimization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a single tertiary care center with telehealth capabilities, all department of surgery providers (attending surgeons, residents, fellows, and advanced practice providers) were emailed a voluntary survey focused on telehealth during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U analyses were performed as appropriate on responses. Text responses were thematically coded to identify key concepts. RESULTS: The completion rate was 41.3% (145/351). Providers reported increased telehealth usage relative to the pandemic (p<0.001). Of respondents, 80% (116/145) had no formal telehealth training. Providers estimated that new patient video visits required less time than traditional visits (p=0.001). Satisfaction was high for several aspects of video visits. Comparatively lower satisfaction scores were reported for the ability to perform physical exams (sensitive and non-sensitive) and to break bad news. The largest barriers to effective video visits were limited physical exams (55.6%; 45/81) and lack of provider or patient internet access/equipment/connection (34.6%; 28/81). Other barriers included ineffective communication and difficulty with fostering rapport. Concerns regarding video-to-telephone visit conversion were loss of physical exam/verbal cues (34.3%; 24/70), less personal interactions (18.6%; 13/70), and reduced efficiency (18.6%; 13/70). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth remains a new experience for surgical providers despite its expansion. Optimization strategies should target technology barriers and include specialized virtual exam and communication training."
Community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in a patient with chronic lymphatic leukaemia,"Described here is a severe case of community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia that occurred in a previously healthy 54-year-old male who was later determined to have stage A chronic lymphatic leukemia. The clinical presentation was consistent with that of atypical pneumonia. Testing with PCR revealed adenovirus in a bronchoalveolar lavage sample, while all other tests to determine a bacterial or virological etiology were negative. Further examination of the patient revealed the previously undiagnosed chronic lymphatic leukemia. Following treatment with human immunoglobulin and oxygen therapy with continuous positive airway pressure support the patient recovered from the pneumonia completely."
CD103+CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cell infiltration predicts clinical outcome and adjuvant therapeutic benefit in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.,"BACKGROUND CD103+CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells, associated with better overall survival among various malignancies, are thought to activate anti-tumour immune response and affect therapeutic sensitivity including both immunotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). METHODS Totally 650 muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients from three independent cohorts were included in this study for survival and cisplatin-based ACT response analysis. Another public data set consisting of 195 patients from IMvigor210 trial receiving PD-L1 blockade were involved in the assessment of immunotherapeutic response. Fifty-nine fresh tumour tissues were used to evaluate immune infiltration of CD103+CD8+ TRM cells. RESULTS Patients with high CD103+CD8+ TRM cells infiltration, but not CD8+ T cells, are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy and ACT. The presence of TRM cells is highly associated with an enhanced IFNγ-enriched and T cell-inflamed anti-tumour microenvironment. Elevated CD103+CD8+ TRM cells infiltration correlated with superior ACT response in mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), PIK3CA/AKT and RAS/RAF pathway proficient or histone modification and cell cycle pathway deficient patients. CONCLUSIONS CD103+CD8+ TRM cells played a crucial role in anti-tumour immunity and served as an ideal prognostic biomarker. It could be treated as a superior companion predictor for treatment response to PD-L1 inhibitor and ACT within MIBC patients."
Drive-through Medicine for COVID-19 and Future Pandemics,
P54 Framework for Delivery of Elective Orthopaedic Surgery in the United Kingdom Following the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BACKGROUND: As we enter a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a framework for safe provision of elective orthopaedic surgery must be developed in order to restore and maintain activity. The aim of this study was to explore patient attitudes to surgery and theatre efficiency in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and assess a potential framework for the delivery of such services. METHODS: Prospectively collected data on theatre timings and procedures completed per session used to assess theatre efficiency using 40 patients from June 2019 and 85 patients from June 2020. Information on patient compliance with 14-day household isolation and attitudes to surgery were collected prospectively over a 7-week period using a questionnaire (37 patients included). Follow up data was collected via telephone consultation a minimum of 2 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: Significant reduction in the number of points per session (p = 0.02) with a mean of 3.19 in 2019 and 2.42 in 2020. Only 18 of 31 patients were compliant with pre-operative isolation with individual failures accounting for 4 of 13 and failures by household members accounting for 9. Impact on COVID-19 and precautions on patient anxiety was mixed. No patients required symptomatic COVID-19 swab. INTERPRETATION: With the restrictions of COVID-19 there are significant problems with theatre efficiency, in effect losing an operation a list. Furthermore, compliance with pre-operative isolation was poor. Additional strategies will be required to re-instate an effective elective orthopaedic service, especially as the nation heads into a second wave."
Capsid and Genome Modification Strategies to Reduce the Immunogenicity of Adenoviral Vectors,"Adenovirus-based gene transfer vectors are the most frequently used vector type in gene therapy clinical trials to date, and they play an important role as genetic vaccine candidates during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Immediately upon delivery, adenovirus-based vectors exhibit multiple complex vector-host interactions and induce innate and adaptive immune responses. This can severely limit their safety and efficacy, particularly after delivery through the blood stream. In this review article we summarize two strategies to modulate Ad vector-induced immune responses: extensive genomic and chemical capsid modifications. Both strategies have shown beneficial effects in a number of preclinical studies while potential synergistic effects warrant further investigations."
Square Dance from a Mathematical Perspective,
Change in outbreak epicenter and its impact on the importation risks of COVID-19 progression: a modelling study,"The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in the city of Wuhan, China has now spread to every inhabitable continent, but now theattention has shifted from China to other epicenters, especially Italy. This study explored the influence of spatial proximities and travel patterns from Italy on the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the globe. We showed that as the epicenter changes, the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread change to reflect spatial proximities."
A Series of Patients with Myocarditis Following SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination with mRNA-1279 and BNT162b2,
Pharmacists leadership in a medication shortage response: Illustrative examples from a health system response to the COVID‐19 crisis,"As medication experts, clinical pharmacists play an active and dynamic role in a medication shortage response. Supplementing existing guidelines with an actionable framework of discrete activities to support effective medication shortage responses can expand the scope of pharmacy practice and improve patient care. Dissemination of best practices and illustrative, networked examples from health systems can support the adoption of innovative solutions. In this descriptive report, we document the translation of published shortage mitigation guidelines into system success through broad pharmacist engagement and the adaption and implementation of targeted strategies. The profound, wide‐reaching medication shortages that accompanied the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic are used to highlight coordinated but distinct practices and how they have been combined to expand the influence of the pharmacy enterprise."
Harnessing reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and inflammation: Nanodrugs for liver injury,"Overall, 12% of the global population (800 million) suffers from liver disease, which causes 2 million deaths every year. Liver injury involving characteristic reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) and inflammation plays a key role in progression of liver disease. As a key metabolic organ of the human body, the liver is susceptible to injury from various sources, including COVID-19 infection. Owing to unique structural features and functions of the liver, most current antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs are limited against liver injury. However, the characteristics of the liver could be utilized in the development of nanodrugs to achieve specific enrichment in the liver and consequently targeted treatment. Nanodrugs have shown significant potential in eliminating RONS and regulating inflammation, presenting an attractive therapeutic tool for liver disease through controlling liver injury. Therefore, the main aim of the current review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the latest developments contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying nanodrugs in the treatment of liver injury via harnessing RONS and inflammation. Meanwhile, the prospects of nanodrugs for liver injury therapy are systematically discussed, which provides a sound platform for novel therapeutic insights and inspiration for design of nanodrugs to treat liver disease."
Antigen-based testing but not real-time PCR correlates with SARS-CoV-2 virus culture,"Individuals can test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after no longer being infectious.1-8 Positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based testing exhibits a temporal pattern that corresponds with active, replicating virus and could therefore be a more accurate predictor of an individuals potential to transmit SARS-CoV-2.2,3,9 Using the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 later flow antigen detection test, we demonstrate a higher concordance of antigen-positive test results with the presence of cultured, infectious virus when compared to RT-PCR. When compared to infectious virus isolation, the sensitivity of antigen-based testing is similar to RT-PCR. The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 antigen and SARS-CoV-2 culture represents a significant advancement in determining the risk for potential transmissibility beyond that which can be achieved by detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. Coupled with a rapid time-to-result, low cost, and scalability, antigen-based testing should facilitate effective implementation of testing and public health interventions that will better contain COVID-19."
Restricting Branched-Chain Amino Acids within a High-Fat Diet Prevents Obesity,"Obesity is a global pandemic, but there is yet no effective measure to control it. Recent metabolomics studies have identified a signature of altered amino acid profiles to be associated with obesity, but it is unclear whether these findings have actionable clinical potential. The aims of this study were to reveal the metabolic alterations of obesity and to explore potential strategies to mitigate obesity. We performed targeted metabolomic profiling of the plasma/serum samples collected from six independent cohorts and conducted an individual data meta-analysis of metabolomics for body mass index (BMI) and obesity. Based on the findings, we hypothesized that restriction of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), phenylalanine, or tryptophan may prevent obesity and tested our hypothesis in a dietary restriction trial with eight groups of 4-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n = 5/group) on eight different types of diets, respectively, for 16 weeks. A total of 3397 individuals were included in the meta-analysis. The mean BMI was 30.7 ± 6.1 kg/m(2), and 49% of participants were obese. Fifty-eight metabolites were associated with BMI and obesity (all p ≤ 2.58 × 10(−4)), linked to alterations of the BCAA, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and phospholipid metabolic pathways. The restriction of BCAAs within a high-fat diet (HFD) maintained the mice’s weight, fat and lean volume, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue weight, and serum glucose and insulin at levels similar to those in the standard chow group, and prevented obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy, adipose inflammation, and insulin resistance induced by HFD. Our data suggest that four metabolic pathways, BCAA, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and phospholipid metabolic pathways, are altered in obesity and restriction of BCAAs within a HFD can prevent the development of obesity and insulin resistance in mice, providing a promising strategy to potentially mitigate diet-induced obesity."
The bowel and beyond: extracolonic findings from CT colonography,"CT colonography has emerged as the investigation of choice for suspected colorectal cancer in patients when a colonoscopy in incomplete, is deemed high risk or is declined because of patient preference. Unlike a traditional colonoscopy, it frequently reveals extracolonic as well as colonic findings. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics and potential significance of extracolonic findings on CT colonography within our own institution. A retrospective review was performed of 502 patients who underwent CT colonography in our institution between January 1, 2010 and January 4, 2015. Of 502 patients, 60.63% had at least one extracolonic finding. This was close to other similar-sized studies (Kumar et al. Radiology 236(2):519–526, 2005). However, our rate of E4 findings was significantly higher than that reported in larger studies at 5.3%(Pooler et al. AJR 206:313–318, 2016). The difference may be explained by our combination of symptomatic/screening patients or by the age and gender distribution of our population. Our study lends support to the hypothesis that CT colonography may be particularly useful in identifying clinically significant extracolonic findings in symptomatic patients. CT colonography may allow early identification of extracolonic malignancies and life-threatening conditions such as an abdominal aortic aneurysm at a preclinical stage when they are amenable to medical or surgical intervention. However, extracolonic findings may also result in unnecessary investigations for subsequently benign findings."
"A Multicentre Study of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outcomes of Cancer Patients in Wuhan, China","Background: At present, there is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Two previous case series from China have suggested that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, but the reports were limited by small numbers and few clinical information. Objective: To study clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Four designated COVID-16 hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Medical records of 67 cancer patients admitted to hospitals between Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were included. Measurements: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Survival data of the cohort was cut-off on Mar 10, 2020. Results: Of the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients who had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (P<0.001). Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chronic diseases, and the proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). Twenty-three (34.3%) patients were still at the anticancer treatment phase, but no tumour progression and recurrence was observed for all the patients during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and/or cough (n=50, 74.6%). Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) with COVID-19 was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095). Limitation: This is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from four hospitals. And some specific clinical information was insufficient. Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive attentions to cancer patients infected with COVID-19."
A brief review of the neurological manifestations of the coronavirus disease,"INTRODUCTION: It has been demonstrated experimentally that the coronavirus can enter the central nervous system through olfactory nerves and can even reach medulla. Neurological manifestations are observed more frequently in patients with coronavirus disease. MAIN TEXT: The aim of the review is to seek evidence for infection of the nervous system by the human coronavirus and study the neurological manifestations of the coronavirus and its treatment. A search was done in PubMed, Google Scholar, CrossRef, and Scopus. There is evidence for the coronavirus infection of the nervous system from experimental studies, autopsy reports, and clinical studies. The virus can damage the nervous system either by direct viral damage to the neural cells or by immunopathology. Cerebral edema, neuronal degeneration, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain–Barré Syndrome, Bickerstaff’s brainstem encephalitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, polyneuritis, toxic encephalopathy, and stroke can occur. The coronavirus has been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction technique in infected patients. The abnormalities of the coagulation system increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Chloroquine analogs, lopinavir/ritonavir combination, remdesivir, dexamethasone, and immunoglobulin have been shown to be useful for the treatment. CONCLUSION: There is substantial evidence for infection of the nervous system by the different strains of the human coronavirus. The coronavirus enters the nervous system either by the blood or from the olfactory nerves. The neurological diseases correlate with the severity of the coronavirus disease. The treatment is mainly supportive. The reports of patients with encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and brainstem encephalitis show slow recovery. But a stroke has a high mortality."

HIV Diagnosis and the Clinical Course of COVID-19 Among Patients Seeking Care Within the New York City Public Hospital System During the Initial Pandemic Peak,"Reports conflict on how HIV infection influences the clinical course of COVID-19. The New York City (NYC) public hospital system provides care for over 14,000 people with HIV, was central in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is therefore in a unique position to evaluate the intersection of these concurrent infections. Retrospective chart review of patients presenting to NYC Health and Hospitals (NYC H+H) diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from March 1, 2020, through April 28, 2020, compared people living with HIV (PLWH) and a propensity-matched (PM) control group of patients without HIV to evaluate associations between HIV status and COVID-19 outcomes. Two hundred thirty-four PLWH presented for COVID-19 testing and 110 (47%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among 17,413 patients with COVID-19 and without HIV, 1:n nearest neighbor propensity score matching identified 194 patients matched on age, sex, race, and any comorbidity. In the sample with COVID-19 (N = 304), PLWH (9.1%) had lower rates of mortality than controls [19.1%; PM odds ratio (PM-OR): 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.19-0.86]. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N = 179), HIV infection was associated with lower rates of mechanical ventilation (PM-OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.11-0.84) and mortality (PM-OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0. 17-0.95). In the extended pandemic period through April 2021, aggregate data by HIV status suggested elevated hospitalization and mortality rates in PLWH versus people without HIV. These results suggest that the direct biological impacts of the HIV virus do not negatively influence COVID-19-related outcomes when controlling for comorbidity and demographic variables."
"Temporal Dynamics and Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Demonstrate the Necessity of Ongoing Viral Genome Sequencing in Ontario, Canada","Genome-wide variation in SARS-CoV-2 reveals evolution and transmission dynamics which are critical considerations for disease control and prevention decisions. Here, we review estimates of the genome-wide viral mutation rates, summarize current COVID-19 case load in the province of Ontario, Canada (5 January 2021), and analyze published SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Ontario (collected prior to 24 November 2020) to test for more infectious genetic variants or lineages. The reported mutation rate (∼10(−6) nucleotide [nt](−1) cycle(−1)) for SARS-CoV-2 is typical for coronaviruses. Analysis of published SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that the G614 spike protein mutation has dominated infections in Ontario and that SARS-CoV-2 lineages present in Ontario have not differed significantly in their rate of spread. These results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 population circulating in Ontario has not changed significantly to date. However, ongoing genome monitoring is essential for identification of new variants and lineages that may contribute to increased viral transmission."
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and Africa: acclaimed home remedies,"At last the WHO declared the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) now known as COVID-19 a pandemic. Amidst uncertainty both in the pathophysiology and the management of COVID-19, many African countries in the face of either over-stretched or non-existent healthcare infrastructure resorted to home remedies as immediate alternative or first line of action. The present study is a synoptic capture of these home remedies with an attempt to understand the pharmacological basis on which these choices are predicated. Literature was compiled from google, social media, Radio and Television commentaries and news with stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Natural spices (turmeric, ginger, garlic etc) and leaves (neem, paw paw, guava, etc) with notable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties were found to be beneficial. These home remedies may hold promise in the prophylaxis and cure of COVID-19 infection."
"Interaction of the New Inhibitor Paxlovid (PF-07321332) and Ivermectin With the Monomer of the Main Protease SARS-CoV-2: A Volumetric Study Based on Molecular Dynamics, Elastic Networks, Classical Thermodynamics and SPT","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the study of drugs, most notably ivermectin and more recently Paxlovid (PF-07321332) which is in phase III clinical trials with experimental data showing covalent binding to the viral protease M(pro). Theoretical developments of catalytic site-directed docking support thermodynamically feasible non-covalent binding to M(pro). Here we show that Paxlovid binds non-covalently at regions other than the catalytic sites with energies stronger than reported and at the same binding site as the ivermectin B1a homologue, all through theoretical methodologies, including blind docking. We volumetrically characterize the non-covalent interaction of the ivermectin homologues (avermectins B1a and B1b) and Paxlovid with the mM(pro) monomer, through molecular dynamics and scaled particle theory (SPT). Using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), we estimated the electric dipole moment fluctuations at the surface of each of complex involved in this study, with similar trends to that observed in the interaction volume. Using fluctuations of the intrinsic volume and the number of flexible fragments of proteins using anisotropic and Gaussian elastic networks (ANM+GNM) suggests the complexes with ivermectin are more dynamic and flexible than the unbound monomer. In contrast, the binding of Paxlovid to mM(pro) shows that the mM(pro)-PF complex is the least structurally dynamic of all the species measured in this investigation. The results support a differential molecular mechanism of the ivermectin and PF homologues in the mM(pro) monomer. Finally, the results showed that Paxlovid despite beingbound in different sites through covalent or non-covalent forms behaves similarly in terms of its structural flexibility and volumetric behaviour."
"How death anxiety influences coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic: investigating the role of spirituality, national identity, lockdown and trust","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a highly stressful environment in which reminders of death are constant. This context of permanent mortality salience is likely to arouse death anxiety in individuals around the world that they must manage. This study investigates the effects of death anxiety on the adoption of different coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in five different countries (N = 721, mean age = 32.83). The results show that higher levels of death anxiety mainly lead to the adoption of avoidance coping strategies and that spirituality and national identity moderate this effect, whereas lockdown does not. Moreover, trust in institutions is a mediator in the relationship between death anxiety and avoidance strategies."
After COVID-19: Thinking Differently About Running the Health Care System.,
"Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 17 Hospitalized Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infections Outside Wuhan, China","An increasing number of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) infected with 2019-nCoV have been identified in Wuhan and other cities in China, since December 2019. We analyzed data on the 17 confirmed cases in Dazhou to provide the epidemiologic characteristics of NCP outside Wuhan. Among them, 12 patients were still quarantined in the hospital, 5 patients were discharged NCP patients according to the national standards. Compared with non-discharged NCP patients, the discharged NCP patients had younger ages. Moreover, discharged NCP patients had higher heart rate, lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels than non-discharged NCP patients on admission to the hospital. Notably, all of 17 patients had abnormal increased C-reactive protein levels, and 16 patients had abnormal computed tomography images. This study provided some information that younger age, higher lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels at the diagnoses of 2019-nCoV may contributed to faster recovery and better therapeutic outcome."
Age-Dependent Reduction in Asthmatic Pathology through Reprogramming of Postviral Inflammatory Responses,"Asthma is a chronic disease of childhood, but for unknown reasons, disease activity sometimes subsides as children mature. In this study, we present clinical and animal model evidence suggesting that the age dependency of childhood asthma stems from an evolving host response to respiratory viral infection. Using clinical data, we show that societal suppression of respiratory virus transmission during coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown disrupted the traditional age gradient in pediatric asthma exacerbations, connecting the phenomenon of asthma remission to virus exposure. In mice, we show that asthmatic lung pathology triggered by Sendai virus (SeV) or influenza A virus is highly age-sensitive: robust in juvenile mice (4-6 wk old) but attenuated in mature mice (>3 mo old). Interestingly, allergen induction of the same asthmatic traits was less dependent on chronological age than viruses. Age-specific responses to SeV included a juvenile bias toward type 2 airway inflammation that emerged early in infection, whereas mature mice exhibited a more restricted bronchiolar distribution of infection that produced a distinct type 2 low inflammatory cytokine profile. In the basal state, aging produced changes to lung leukocyte burden, including the number and transcriptional landscape of alveolar macrophages (AMs). Importantly, depleting AMs in mature mice restored post-SeV pathology to juvenile levels. Thus, aging influences chronic outcomes of respiratory viral infection through regulation of the AM compartment and type 2 inflammatory responses to viruses. Our data provide insight into how asthma remission might develop in children."
Modeling the pandemic trend of 2019 Coronavirus with optimal control analysis,"In this work, we propose a mathematical model to analyze the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The proposed model portrays the multiple transmission pathways in the infection dynamics and stresses the role of the environmental reservoir in the transmission of the disease. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is calculated from the model to assess the transmissibility of the COVID-19. We discuss sensitivity analysis to clarify the importance of epidemic parameters. The stability theory is used to discuss the local as well as the global properties of the proposed model. The problem is formulated as an optimal control one to minimize the number of infected people and keep the intervention cost as low as possible. Medical mask, isolation, treatment, detergent spray will be involved in the model as time dependent control variables. Finally, we present and discuss results by using numerical simulations."
Japan ECMOnet for COVID-19: telephone consultations for cases with severe respiratory failure caused by COVID-19,"Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started spreading in Japan. Therefore, the number of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is expected to increase. A working group has been formed to provide telephone consultation services for cases with severe respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 in Japan. During the first 13 days of the service, there were 12 consultations. For each consultation, we advised the patient on the initiation of ECMO and arranged transportation for patients with ECMO. Based on experience from the H1N1 influenza pandemic, transporting patients to experienced facilities is essential to obtain better outcomes."

Determining clinically relevant features in cytometry data using persistent homology,"Cytometry experiments yield high-dimensional point cloud data that is difficult to interpret manually. Boolean gating techniques coupled with comparisons of relative abundances of cellular subsets is the current standard for cytometry data analysis. However, this approach is unable to capture more subtle topological features hidden in data, especially if those features are further masked by data transforms or significant batch effects or donor-to-donor variations in clinical data. We present that persistent homology, a mathematical structure that summarizes the topological features, can distinguish different sources of data, such as from groups of healthy donors or patients, effectively. Analysis of publicly available cytometry data describing non-naïve CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls shows that systematic structural differences exist between single cell protein expressions in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Our method identifies proteins of interest by a decision-tree based classifier and passes them to a kernel-density estimator (KDE) for sampling points from the density distribution. We then compute persistence diagrams from these sampled points. The resulting persistence diagrams identify regions in cytometry datasets of varying density and identify protruded structures such as ‘elbows’. We compute Wasserstein distances between these persistence diagrams for random pairs of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients and find that systematic structural differences exist between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in the expression data for T-bet, Eomes, and Ki-67. Further analysis shows that expression of T-bet and Eomes are significantly downregulated in COVID-19 patient non-naïve CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This counter-intuitive finding may indicate that canonical effector CD8+ T cells are less prevalent in COVID-19 patients than healthy controls. This method is applicable to any cytometry dataset for discovering novel insights through topological data analysis which may be difficult to ascertain otherwise with a standard gating strategy or in the presence of large batch effects. Author summary Identifying differences between cytometry data seen as a point cloud can be complicated by random variations in data collection and data sources. We apply persistent homology used in topological data analysis to describe the shape and structure of the data representing immune cells in healthy donors and COVID-19 patients. By looking at how the shape and structure differ between healthy donors and COVID-19 patients, we are able to definitively conclude how these groups differ despite random variations in the data. Furthermore, these results are novel in their ability to capture shape and structure of cytometry data, something not described by other analyses."
Artificial intelligence-based prediction for cancer-related outcomes in Africa: Status and potential refinements,
OP03 Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody responses are attenuated in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease treated with infliximab,"BACKGROUND: Anti-TNF drugs increase the risk of serious respiratory infections and impair protective immunity following pneumococcal, influenza, and viral hepatitis vaccinations. Therefore, we sought to determine whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with infliximab have attenuated serological responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CLARITY IBD is a multicentre, prospective observational cohort study. Antibody responses in participants treated with infliximab were compared to a reference cohort treated with vedolizumab, a gut-selective anti-integrin α4β7 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired vaccine responses or increased susceptibility to systemic infections. 6935 patients were recruited from 92 UK hospitals between (22)nd September and (23)rd December 2020. Nucleocapsid anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies were measured using the Roche Elecsys assay. Clinical data and serum were collected every 8 weeks. Durability was defined as nonreduction in antibody level by at least 50% from baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, rates of symptomatic and proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar between groups. Seroprevalence was lower in infliximab- than vedolizumab-treated patients (3.4% [161/(4685)], vs 6.0% [134/(2250)], p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed that infliximab (vs vedolizumab; odds ratio [OR] 0.66 [95% CI 0.51–0.(87)], p=0.0027) and immunomodulator use (OR 0.70 [95% CI 0.53–0.(92)], p=0.012) were independently associated with lower seropositivity (Fig 1). In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconversion was observed in fewer infliximab- than vedolizumab-treated patients (48% [39/(81)], vs 83% [30/(36)], p=0.00044) and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV2 reactivity was lower (median 0.8 cut off index (COI) [0.2–5.(6)] vs 37.0 [15.2–76.(1)], p<0.0001). An initial increase in anti-SARS-Cov2 antibody reactivity was observed four weeks after a positive PCR test, in vedolizumab-(47.2 COI [IQR 24.1 - 113.(0)] vs 14.5 COI [IQR 0.4 – 30.(7)], p=0.0079), but not infliximab-treated patients (0.7 COI [IQR 0.2 - 7.(5)] vs 1.1 COI [IQR 0.4 - 4.(5)], p=0.70) (Fig 2). Antibody responses after an initial positive reading were also less durable in infliximab-treated patients (hazard ratio 5.15 [95%CI 2.95–9.(00)]; Fig 3), but durability was not influenced by immunomodulator use. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence, seroconversion in PCR-confirmed cases, and the magnitude and durability of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies were reduced in infliximab- compared with vedolizumab-treated patients. Serological testing and virus surveillance should be considered in patients treated with anti-TNF drugs to detect suboptimal vaccine responses, persistent infection, and viral evolution to inform public health policy."

Insomnia and nightmare profiles during the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal: characterization and associated factors,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: To describe and characterize insomnia symptoms and nightmare profiles in Portugal during the first six weeks of a national lockdown due to COVID-19. PATIENTS/METHODS: An open cohort study was conducted to collect information of the general population during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. We analyzed data from 5011 participants (≥16 years) who answered a weekly questionnaire about their well-being. Two questions about the frequency of insomnia and nightmares about COVID-19 were consecutively applied during six weeks (March-May 2020). Latent class analysis was conducted and different insomnia and nightmare profiles were identified. Associations between individual characteristics and both profiles were estimated using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Five insomnia (No insomnia, Stable-mild, Decreasing-moderate, Stable-severe, Increasing-severe) and three nightmares profiles (Stable-mild, Stable-moderate, Stable-severe) were identified, respectively. Being female, younger, perceiving their income as insufficient and feelings of fear towards COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of insomnia (Women: OR=6.98 95%CI:4.18-11.64; ≥60 years: OR=0.30 95%CI:0.18-0.53); Insufficient income: aOR=8.413 95%CI:3.93-16.84; Often presenting fear of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection: aOR=9.13 95%CI:6.36-13.11), and nightmares (Women: OR=2.60 95%CI:1.74-3.86; ≥60 years: OR=0.45 95%CI:0.28-0.74) Insufficient income: aOR=2.60 95%CI:1.20-5.20; Often/almost always presenting fear of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection: aOR=6.62 95%CI:5.01-8.74). Having a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection was associated with worse patterns of nightmares about the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Social and psychological individual factors are important characteristics to consider in the development of therapeutic strategies to support people with sleep problems during COVID-19 pandemic."
A systematic review of lopinavir therapy for SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus—A possible reference for coronavirus disease‐19 treatment option,"In the past few decades, coronaviruses have risen as a global threat to public health. Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19) from Wuhan caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID‐19. However, there are agents that were used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics. We could learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus. In this review, we discuss the literature on the efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo, especially in patients with SARS and MERS, so that we might clarify the potential for the use of LPV in patients with COVID‐19."
Calculating the number of undetected active SARS-CoV-2 infections from results of population-wide antigen tests,"Current European research estimates the number of undetected active SARS-CoV-2 infections (dark figure) to be two- to 130-fold the number of detected cases. We revisited the population-wide antigen tests in Slovakia and South Tyrol and calculated the dark figure of active cases in the vulnerable populations and the number of undetected active cases per detected active case at the time of the population-wide tests. Our analysis follows three steps: using the sensitivities and specificities of the used antigen tests, we first calculated the number of test-positive individuals and the proportion of actual positives in those who participated in the antigen tests. We then calculated the dark figure in the total population of Slovakia and South Tyrol, respectively. Finally, we calculated the ratio of the dark figure in the vulnerable population to the number of newly detected infections through PCR tests. Per one positive PCR result, another 0.15 to 0.71 cases must be added in South Tyrol and 0.01 to 1.25 cases in Slovakia. The dark figure was in both countries lower than assumed by earlier studies."
Prévalence importante et mauvais pronostic de la dysfonction tubulaire proximale au cours du SDRA COVID en réanimation : l’étude URICOV,"Introduction La protéinurie et l’insuffisance rénale aiguë sont fréquentes au cours du COVID-19, et associées à la morbi-mortalité, mais la pathogénicité directe du SARS-CoV-2 sur le rein reste débattue. Notre objectif était d’évaluer la prévalence et la valeur pronostique de la tubulopathie proximale chez les patients en SDRA COVID en réanimation. Description Dans cette étude de cohorte prospective multicentrique, étaient inclus les patients majeurs présentant une détresse respiratoire nécessitant la ventilation mécanique avec rapport PaO2/FiO2<300 dans les 24h de l’intubation. Méthodes Nous réalisions une analyse détaillée des marqueurs de dysfonction rénale avec électrophorèse des protéines urinaires (EPU) dans les 24h de l’intubation chez 85 patients en réanimation pour un SDRA COVID. Résultats Seulement 16 (18,8 %) des patients présentaient une IRA initiale. L’uricémie était abaissée (moyenne 212μmol/L), 87,1 % des patients présentaient une glycosurie. Une hématurie microscopique était retrouvée chez 74 (87,1 %) patients. Les rapports protéinurie/créatinine et albuminurie/créatinine étaient de 785 et 142 mg/g. L’EPU retrouvant un profil tubulaire chez 91 % des patients, avec une atteinte glomérulaire surajoutée dans chez 17 %. Il existait une fuite urinaire massive d’alpha-1-microglobuline (a1m, 96,1 % des patients), beta-2-microglobuline (b2m, 95,8 %), chaînes légères kappa et lambda (CLL) (100 % et 93,5 %) et Vitamine-D-Binding-Protein (87,5 %). Après un suivi moyen de 28jours, 37 patients (43,5 %) ont développé une insuffisance rénale aiguë (13 KDIGO3, 3 nécessitant la dialyse). Les patients ayant développé une IRA KDIGO3 avaient une urémie, une créatininémie, des rapports protéinurie/créatininurie, albuminurie/créatininurie et a1m/créatininurie significativement plus élevés et une bicarbonatémie plus basse. La dexamethasone semblait protéger de l’IRA. La survenue d’une IRA et des rapports b2m/créatininurie et CLLl/créatininurie plus élevés était associés à la mortalité (p = 0,027, p = 0,04, p = 0,005, respectivement) (Fig. 1). Conclusion Les patients développant un SDRA au cours du COVID-19 présentent une dysfonction tubulaire proximale, précédant l’IRA, qui semble être un mécanisme important de la néphropathie COVID et pourrait être un marqueur de sévérité."
Molecular Phylogenesis and Spatiotemporal Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Southeast Asia,"Background: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed an unprecedented challenge to public health in Southeast Asia, a tropical region with limited resources. This study aimed to investigate the evolutionary dynamics and spatiotemporal patterns of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the region. Materials and Methods: A total of 1491 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 10 Southeast Asian countries were downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database on November 17, 2020. The evolutionary relationships were assessed using maximum likelihood (ML) and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, and the phylogenetic clustering was tested using principal component analysis (PCA). The spatial patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread within Southeast Asia were inferred using the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) model. The effective population size (Ne) trajectory was inferred using the Bayesian Skygrid model. Results: Four major clades (including one potentially endemic) were identified based on the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree. Similar clustering was yielded by PCA; the first three PCs explained 46.9% of the total genomic variations among the samples. The time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Southeast Asia were estimated to be November 28, 2019 (September 7, 2019 to January 4, 2020) and 1.446 × 10(−3) (1.292 × 10(−3) to 1.613 × 10(−3)) substitutions per site per year, respectively. Singapore and Thailand were the two most probable root positions, with posterior probabilities of 0.549 and 0.413, respectively. There were high-support transmission links (Bayes factors exceeding 1,000) in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia; Malaysia involved the highest number (7) of inferred transmission links within the region. A twice-accelerated viral population expansion, followed by a temporary setback, was inferred during the early stages of the pandemic in Southeast Asia. Conclusions: With available genomic data, we illustrate the phylogeography and phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Southeast Asia. Continuous genomic surveillance and enhanced strategic collaboration should be listed as priorities to curb the pandemic, especially for regional communities dominated by developing countries."
Shifting our stance for current COVID-19 outbreaks: A global response to an international pandemic,
Interval forecasts of weekly incident and cumulative COVID-19 mortality in the United States: A comparison of combining methods,"BACKGROUND: A combined forecast from multiple models is typically more accurate than an individual forecast, but there are few examples of studies of combining in infectious disease forecasting. We investigated the accuracy of different ways of combining interval forecasts of weekly incident and cumulative coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) mortality. METHODS: We considered weekly interval forecasts, for 1- to 4-week prediction horizons, with out-of-sample periods of approximately 18 months ending on 8 January 2022, for multiple locations in the United States, using data from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Our comparison involved simple and more complex combining methods, including methods that involve trimming outliers or performance-based weights. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using interval scores, weighted interval scores, skill scores, ranks, and reliability diagrams. RESULTS: The weighted inverse score and median combining methods performed best for forecasts of incident deaths. Overall, the leading inverse score method was 12% better than the mean benchmark method in forecasting the 95% interval and, considering all interval forecasts, the median was 7% better than the mean. Overall, the median was the most accurate method for forecasts of cumulative deaths. Compared to the mean, the median’s accuracy was 65% better in forecasting the 95% interval, and 43% better considering all interval forecasts. For all combining methods except the median, combining forecasts from only compartmental models produced better forecasts than combining forecasts from all models. CONCLUSIONS: Combining forecasts can improve the contribution of probabilistic forecasting to health policy decision making during epidemics. The relative performance of combining methods depends on the extent of outliers and the type of models in the combination. The median combination has the advantage of being robust to outlying forecasts. Our results support the Hub’s use of the median and we recommend further investigation into the use of weighted methods."
Chapter 25 Arteriviridae and Roniviridae,"Publisher Summary Viruses in the Arteriviridae and Roniviridae families have very different virion morphology, but the grouping reflects their common and distinctive replication strategy that uses a nested set of 3´ coterminal subgenomic messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The family Roniviridae contains viruses that are detected only in crustaceans, specifically, several genotypes of gill-associated and yellow head viruses. The host range of arteriviruses is highly restricted, and all arteriviruses share the capacity to establish asymptomatic prolonged or persistent infections in their respective natural hosts; most can cause severe disease in certain circumstances. The family Arteriviridae comprises a single genus, Arterivirus, which contains all member viruses, and the family Roniviridae contains a single genus, Okavirus. Arterivirus virions are enveloped, spherical, and 45–60 nm in diameter, which is only about half the size of those of coronaviruses. Arteriviruses replicate in macrophages and a very limited number of other cell types within their respective hosts. The host range of arteriviruses is highly restricted, and the viruses typically grow in vitro only in cultured macrophages, macrophage cell lines, and a few other cell lines. Some arteriviruses effectively can subvert protective host innate immune responses, including apoptosis of infected macrophages and interferon signaling pathways."
"Assessment of Day-7 Postexposure Testing of Asymptomatic Contacts of COVID-19 Patients to Evaluate Early Release from Quarantine — Vermont, May–November 2020","On May 8, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) issued a Health Update* recommending shortening the duration of quarantine for persons exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Exposed persons who were in quarantine could be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on or after quarantine day 7. Those who had remained asymptomatic throughout quarantine and who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on or after day 7 could end quarantine. This policy was based on a report suggesting that symptom onset occurs within this time frame in approximately three quarters of COVID-19 cases (1) and on consultation of the Vermont Health Commissioner with the U.S. Surgeon General. VDH implemented this policy to minimize restrictions on state residents, recognizing that some reduction could occur in the prevention benefit of quarantine to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. State-run SARS-CoV-2 testing sites were made available to increase access to no-cost testing and facilitate implementation of this policy. During August 1-December 1, among persons seeking testing at a VDH SARS-CoV-2 testing site, 36% stated that their reason for seeking testing was to end quarantine early (VDH, unpublished data, December 7, 2020), indicating that persons were aware of and following the policy and using the testing services provided. To assess the effectiveness of this policy, VDH analyzed testing data for contacts of persons with a COVID-19 diagnosis. During May 8-November 16, VDH identified 8,798 exposed contacts of COVID-19 patients; 3,983 (45%) had sought testing within 14 days of their exposure, with day 0 defined as the date of last exposure noted in the case investigation record. Among these persons, 2,200 (55%) who received testing on days 7-10 were included in this analysis; 977 (44.9%) of these contacts had a specimen collected for testing on day 7. Among these, 34 (3%) had test results that were positive, 940 (96%) had results that were negative, and three (<1%) had results that were indeterminate (Table). Among the 34 contacts who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on day 7 after exposure, 12 (35%) were asymptomatic. The remaining 22 contacts with positive test results were symptomatic at the time of testing; approximately one half had developed symptoms on days 4-7 after exposure. Among the 940 contacts who received negative test results on specimens collected on day 7 after exposure, 154 (16%) had a subsequent test within the next 7 days (i.e., days 8-14); among these, 152 (99%) had tests that remained negative, and two (1%) had results that were indeterminate."
Prevalence of Sleep Disturbances during COVID-19 Outbreak in an Urban Chinese Population: A Cross-Sectional Study,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is a large-scale public health emergency that likely precipitated sleep disturbances in the community. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of sleep disturbances during the early phrase of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This web-based cross-sectional study recruited 1,138 Hong Kong adults using convenience sampling over a 2-week period from 6(th) April 2020. The survey collected data on sleep disturbances, mood, stress, stock of infection control supplies, perceived risk of being infected by COVID-19, and sources for acquiring COVID-19 information. The participants were asked to compare their recent sleep and sleep before the outbreak. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was used to assess their current insomnia severity. Prevalence was weighted according to 2016 population census. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of worsened sleep quality, difficulty in sleep initiation, and shortened sleep duration since the outbreak were 38.3%, 29.8%, and 29.1%, respectively. The prevalence of current insomnia (ISI score of ≥10) was 29.9%. Insufficient stock of masks was significantly associated with worsened sleep quality, impaired sleep initiation, shortened sleep duration, and current insomnia in multivariate logistic regression (adjusted OR=1.57, 1.72, 1.99, and 1.96 respectively, all p<0.05). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of people in Hong Kong felt that their sleep had worsened since the COVID-19 outbreak. Insufficient stock of masks was one of the risk factors that were associated with sleep disturbances. Adequate and stable supply of masks may play an important role to maintain the sleep health in the Hong Kong general population during a pandemic outbreak."
"An Ecological Study of Tuberculosis Incidence in China, From 2002 to 2018","INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis is one of the main infectious diseases threatening global health, which is also the main cause of death from a single source of infection (above HIV/AIDS). China is a country with a high burden of tuberculosis in the world, ranking only behind India and Indonesia. However, there are few ecological studies on the burden of tuberculosis in China. This study aims to provide more research basis for the government to formulate tuberculosis policies by exploring the ecological factors associated with the incidence of tuberculosis, so as to achieve the goal of eliminating tuberculosis by 2030. METHODS: We collected data on the incidence of tuberculosis and ecological factors of 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in Mainland China (excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau) from 2002 to 2018. We constructed a framework of ecological factors affecting the incidence, which consists of 5 secondary indicators and 35 tertiary indicators. And we construct a dynamic panel data model based on the Lasso Regression to select variables to test the effect of each ecological factor on the incidence. RESULTS: Among the 35 tertiary indicators, economy 3,4,6,7, environment 1, recourses 1,3, demography 3, and lifecare 2,4,8,9,13 passed the significance test at the 1% level, economy 1,2,5, environment 2,9, lifecare 6,12 passed the significance test at the 5% level, lifecare 10 passed the significance test at the 10% level. Only economy 5 and economy 6 have a positive impact on the incidence, other statistically significant ecological indicators are negatively correlated with the incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that many ecological factors, including residents' income, unemployment rate, educational level, medical resources, population density, sunshine duration and dietary structure, are closely related to the incidence of tuberculosis. These findings contribute the government to taking targeted measures for tuberculosis prevention and control, including improving the level of economic development, increasing employment, expanding the scale of enrollment in colleges and universities, and ensuring that the prices of sources of animal protein are reasonable to meet the residents' intake of protein."
Comparison of risk factors for seropositivity to feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus among cats: a case-case study,"BACKGROUND: Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are reported to have similar risk factors and similar recommendations apply to manage infected cats. However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats’ age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters. RESULTS: In the multivariable random intercept model, the odds of FIV compared to FeLV positive ELISA results were greater for adults (OR = 2.09, CI: 1.50-2.92), intact males (OR = 3.14, CI: 1.85-3.76), neutered males (OR = 2.68, CI: 1.44- 3.14), cats with outdoor access (OR = 2.58, CI: 1.85-3.76) and lower for cats with clinical illness (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.90). The variance components obtained from the model indicated clustering at the testing facility level. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors that have a greater effect on FIV seropositivity include adulthood, being male (neutered or not) and having access to outdoors, while clinical illness was a stronger predictor for FeLV seropositivity. Further studies are warranted to assess the implications of these results for the management and control of these infections."
Mental Health Status of Healthcare Workers in China for COVID-19 Epidemic,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 first appeared in China in December 2019, with a high rate of infectivity and morbidity, which brought tremendous psychological pressure to healthcare workers. PURPOSE: To understand the psychological health status of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and decline, and to provide a theoretical reference for the future establishment of a psychological crisis intervention system. METHODS: Healthcare workers were recruited using convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods, and the electronic version of the SCL-90 scale and a sociodemographic questionnaire were administered. In the pretest, a total of 5018 responses were collected; after six weeks, random sampling was performed. The SCL-90 and measures of other epidemic-related problems were administered, with 1570 responses received; then, the final data analysis was performed. RESULTS: After six weeks, the post-test GSI score; SCL-90 total score; and PST, PSDI, O-C, I-S, DEP, ANX, PHOB, PAR, PSY, and HOS scores were significantly lower than the corresponding pretest scores (p < 0.05). The results by occupational category showed that the scores of nursing staff decreased significantly for 12 indexes and that the scores of the doctors and other hospital staff also significantly decreased. There was a significant difference between the pretest (50.78 ± 28.18) and post-test (45.00 ± 28.49) scores for the degree of worry about the epidemic. Healthcare workers believed that the top three aspects of life affected by the epidemic were economic problems (816 people), interpersonal communication problems (731 people), and mental health (728 people). CONCLUSION: Over the course of the epidemic, the item scores generally declined significantly. Therefore, during an outbreak period, attention should be paid to psychological crisis interventions for healthcare workers; problems caused by psychological pressure, and even other psychological conditions, can be significantly alleviated to reduce the probability of subsequent health problems."
"SARS-CoV-2 infects blood monocytes to activate NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, pyroptosis and cytokine release","SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress that can progress to multiorgan failure and death in some patients. Although severe COVID-19 disease is linked to exuberant inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not understood. Monocytes are sentinel blood cells that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and processing and release of IL-1 family cytokines, potent inflammatory mediators. Here we show that ~10% of blood monocytes in COVID-19 patients are dying and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Monocyte infection, which depends on antiviral antibodies, activates NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, caspase-1 and GSDMD cleavage and relocalization. Signs of pyroptosis (IL-1 family cytokines, LDH) in the plasma correlate with development of severe disease. Moreover, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) linked to higher GSDMD expression increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio, 1.3, p<0.005). These findings taken together suggest that antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of monocytes triggers inflammation that contributes to severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis."
"Sudden death of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China: A retrospective cohort study","BACKGROUND: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. So far, it has caused ~ 4000 deaths in this country. We aimed to systematically characterize clinical features and determine risk factors of sudden death for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Deceased patients with COVID-19 in Tongji hospital from January 22 to March 23, 2020 were extracted. Patients who died within 24 hours after admission were identified as sudden deaths, and the others formed non-sudden deaths. The differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups were estimated. Risk factors associated with sudden deaths were explored by logistic regression. RESULTS: 281 deceased patients were enrolled in this study. Sudden death occurred in 28 (10.0%) patients, including 4 (14.3%) admitted to the intensive care unit. Fatigue was more common in sudden deaths (11, 47.8%) than in non-sudden deaths (40, 17.2%). Both the count and percentage of eosinophils were lower in sudden deaths than that in non-sudden deaths (P = 0.006 and P = 0.004). Compared with non-sudden deaths, sudden deaths had higher plasma levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. There were not significant differences in gender, age, chest CT image features and comorbidities observed. CONCLUSIONS: The differences between the two groups suggested more severe systemic inflammation, multi-organ dysfunction, especially impaired liver and heart function in COVID-19 patients who died suddenly after admission. More researches are needed to verify these points."
Real-Time Smart Patient Monitoring and Assessment Amid COVID-19 Pandemic – an Alternative Approach to Remote Monitoring,
Anxiety and fear related to coronavirus disease 2019 assessment in the Spanish population: A cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide, compromising the responsiveness of governments and states and thus generating anxiety and fear at the population level. OBJECTIVE To assess the level of anxiety and fear of coronavirus disease 2019 in a Spanish adult population group. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study, using the anxiety and fear of COVID-19 assessment scale (AMICO, for its acronym in Spanish). The sample was composed of 1038 subjects. Univariate and bivariate statistical analyses were performed, after analysis of normality in the data distribution. Categorical regression analyses were also executed. FINDINGS The total sample size was 1036 subjects, 56.3% was made up of females, with a mean age of 48.11 years (SD = 15.13). The mean score obtained on the AMICO scale was 5.54 points (SD = 1.83), with a score range between 1.22 and 10. Bivariate analysis only demonstrated statistically significant differences in the mean score of the scale and the variables: sex, marital status, work area and academic level. The executed categorical regression analysis revealed an R2 value of 0.75 and a significance of p = 0.00. CONCLUSIONS The results obtained show that the Spanish population presents moderate anxiety levels to coronavirus disease 2019. Women, married, with primary and/or secondary education level, and working in the public transport, services and/or hospitality sectors are more likely to have high levels of fear and anxiety. APPLICATION TO PRACTICE These results could be used for therapeutic and preventive psychological interventions, and also to plan new research under sex perspective and observing the socio-economic environment."
The Contribution of Citizens to Community-Based Medical Education in Japan: A Systematic Review,"Community-based medical education (CBME) offers vital support to healthcare professionals in aging societies, which need medical trainees who understand comprehensive care. In teaching comprehensive care practices, CBME can involve citizens from the relevant community. This research synthesizes the impact of the involvement of communities on the learning of medical trainees in CBME. We conducted a systematic review, in which we searched ten databases from April 1990 to August 2020 for original articles in Japan regarding CBME involving citizens and descriptively analyzed them. The Kirkpatrick model was used to categorize the outcomes. Our search for studies following the protocol returned 1240 results; 21 articles were included in this systematic review. Medical trainees reported satisfaction with the content, teaching processes, and teachers’ qualities. Medical trainees’ attitudes toward community and rural medicine improved; they were motivated to become family physicians and work in communities and remote areas. This review clarified that citizen involvement in CBME had an effective impact on medical trainees, positively affecting perceptions of this type of education, as well as improving trainees’ knowledge about and attitude toward community and rural medicine."
Effectiveness of contact tracing to reduce fatality from COVID-19: preliminary evidence from Colombia,"Objectives Conducting contact tracing programs in low and middle-income countries is challenging and there is no evidence of their effectiveness in Latin America. We evaluated the effectiveness of contact tracing on reducing fatality from COVID-19 in Colombia. Study design Retrospective cohort study with nation-wide data of suspected and confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their registered contacts. Methods We analyzed confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their chains of contact using a nation-wide registry from March 28, 2020 to January 13, 2021. To estimate the effect of contact tracing on fatality we adjusted a multilevel negative binomial model using as outcome variable the number of deaths and off-set variable the number of people within a chain of contacts. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using different cut-off values of contacts traced and a logistic model for the effect of contact tracing on death at individual level. Results We analyzed 1,4 million cases, 542 936 chains of contact, and 46 087 deaths. Only 5,8% of total cases and contacts were included in a chain of a case and five or more contacts. We found that tracing of at least five contacts per case reduce fatality by 48% (95% CI: 45-51) and, at the current levels of tracing in Colombia, it prevents 1.8% of deaths. Results obtained from the sensitivity analysis were consistent with the reduction of fatality at individual level and higher protective effect with higher number of contacts traced. Conclusions In Colombia, tracing of at least five contacts per case reduces fatality from COVID-19. The coverage and intensity of tracing needs to be increased as a strategy to mitigate fatality in Colombia."
Delivering hands‐on pre‐clinical orthodontic education in the remote age,
Adapting IAPT services to support frontline NHS staff during the Covid-19 pandemic: the Homerton Covid Psychological Support (HCPS) pathway,"The Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is exerting unprecedented pressure on NHS Health and Social Care provisions, with frontline staff, such as those of critical care units, encountering vast practical and emotional challenges on a daily basis. Although staff are being supported through organisational provisions, facilitated by those in leadership roles, the emergence of mental health difficulties or the exacerbation of existing ones amongst these members of staff is a cause for concern. Acknowledging this, academics and healthcare professionals alike are calling for psychological support for frontline staff, which not only addresses distress during the initial phases of the outbreak but also over the months, if not years, that follow. Fortunately, mental health services and psychology professional bodies across the United Kingdom have issued guidance to meet these needs. An attempt has been made to translate these sets of guidance into clinical provisions via the recently established Homerton Covid Psychological Support (HCPS) pathway delivered by Talk Changes (Hackney & City IAPT). This article describes the phased, stepped-care and evidence-based approach that has been adopted by the service to support local frontline NHS staff. We wish to share our service design and pathway of care with other Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services who may also seek to support hospital frontline staff within their associated NHS Trusts and in doing so, lay the foundations of a coordinated response. KEY LEARNING AIMS: (1).. To understand the ways staff can be psychologically and emotionally impacted by working on the frontline of disease outbreaks. (2).. To understand the ways in which IAPT services have previously supported populations exposed to crises. (3).. To learn ways of delivering psychological support and interventions during a pandemic context based on existing guidance and research."
Plant-based vaccines and antibodies to combat COVID-19: current status and prospects,"Globally, researchers are undertaking significant efforts to design and develop effective vaccines, therapeutics, and antiviral drugs to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Plants have been used for the production of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory proteins, drugs, and pharmaceuticals via molecular farming/transient expression system and are considered as bioreactors or factories for their bulk production. These biological products are stable, safe, effective, easily available, and affordable. Plant molecular farming could facilitate rapid production of biologics on an industrial scale, and has the potential to fulfill emergency demands, such as in the present situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article aims to describe the methodology and basics of plant biopharming, in addition to its prospective applications for developing effective vaccines and antibodies to counter COVID-19."
Influence of aging on deterioration of patients with COVID-19,"Aging is an important factor affecting the deterioration of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aging and degeneration of various tissues and organs in the elderly lead to impaired organ function. Underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in aged patients are associated with higher mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily interacts with the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and other accessory proteins such as 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CD147. Thus, altered receptor signals in aging and chronic disease play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are associated with a higher risk of deterioration in different organs. In this review, after a brief introduction to the link between aging and receptors for SARS-CoV-2, we focus on the risk of deterioration in different organs of COVID-19 patients considering aging as the main factor. We further discuss the structural and/or physiological changes in the immune system and organs (lung, heart, kidney, vessels, nerve system), as well as those associated with diabetes, in aging patients, and speculate on the most likely mechanisms underlying the deterioration of COVID-19 patients."
Leveraging Tweets for Artificial Intelligence Driven Sentiment Analysis on the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a disastrous event that has elevated several psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. At the same time, social scientists and psychologists have gained significant interest in understanding the way people express emotions and sentiments at the time of pandemics. During the rise in COVID-19 cases with stricter lockdowns, people expressed their sentiments on social media. This offers a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. By exploiting user-generated content on social media such as Twitter, people’s thoughts and sentiments can be examined, which aids in introducing health intervention policies and awareness campaigns. The recent developments of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL) models have exposed noteworthy performance in sentiment analysis. With this in mind, this paper presents a new sunflower optimization with deep-learning-driven sentiment analysis and classification (SFODLD-SAC) on COVID-19 tweets. The presented SFODLD-SAC model focuses on the identification of people’s sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. To accomplish this, the SFODLD-SAC model initially preprocesses the tweets in distinct ways such as stemming, removal of stopwords, usernames, link punctuations, and numerals. In addition, the TF-IDF model is applied for the useful extraction of features from the preprocessed data. Moreover, the cascaded recurrent neural network (CRNN) model is employed to analyze and classify sentiments. Finally, the SFO algorithm is utilized to optimally adjust the hyperparameters involved in the CRNN model. The design of the SFODLD-SAC technique with the inclusion of an SFO algorithm-based hyperparameter optimizer for analyzing people’s sentiments on COVID-19 shows the novelty of this study. The simulation analysis of the SFODLD-SAC model is performed using a benchmark dataset from the Kaggle repository. Extensive, comparative results report the promising performance of the SFODLD-SAC model over recent state-of-the-art models with maximum accuracy of 99.65%."
Antisense technology as a potential strategy for the treatment of coronaviruses infection: With focus on COVID‐19,"After the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in December 2019 and the increasing number of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections all over the world, researchers are struggling to investigate effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this infection. Targeting viral small molecules that are involved in the process of infection is a promising strategy. Since many host factors are also used by SARS‐CoV‐2 during various stages of infection, down‐regulating or silencing these factors can serve as an effective therapeutic tool. Several nucleic acid‐based technologies including short interfering RNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, DNAzymes, and ribozymes have been suggested for the control of SARS‐CoV‐2 as well as other respiratory viruses. The antisense technology also plays an indispensable role in the treatment of many other diseases including cancer, influenza, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In this review, we summarised the potential applications of antisense technology for the treatment of coronaviruses and specifically COVID‐19 infection."
Umbelliferone delays the progression of diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting ferroptosis through activation of the Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway,"BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis is a novel form of lipid reactive oxygen species and iron dependent cell death, and it has been shown to be involved in renal tubular injury in diabetic mice. Nrf2 plays an important role in regulating lipid peroxidation and is closely related to ferroptosis. Umbelliferone has antioxidant, anti-glycation and protective effects on diabetic mice. However, the potential mechanisms and underlying effects of these effects in diabetic nephropathy (DN) remain to be investigated. METHODS: 10-week-old male C57BLKS/J db/db, C57BLKS/J db/m mice and HK-2â¯cells cultured with high glucose were used as experimental objects in this study. ROS levels, GSH, MDA and iron content were detected. RESULTS: We found that Umbelliferone can significantly improve the renal pathological damage and ROS accumulation of db/db mice, and inhibit ferroptosis, such as the down-regulation of ACSL4 and the up-regulation of GPX4. Meanwhile, Nrf2 and HO-1 expression were up-regulated. We demonstrated that knockdown of Nrf2 blocked the inhibitory effect of Umbelliferone on ferroptosis in renal tubule cells induced by high glucose. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Umbelliferone has a protective effect on DN, possibly by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, thus attenuating the level of high glucose-induced ferroptosis."
HIGH VERSUS STANDARD DOSES OF CORTICOSTEROIDS IN COVID-19 PATIENTS WITH AN ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: a controlled observational comparative study.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the increasing evidence of the benefit of corticosteroids for the treatment of moderate-severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, no data are available about the potential role of high doses of steroids for these patients. METHODS: All consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a single center were selected, including those treated with steroids and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients were allocated to the high doses (HD, 250mg/day or more of methylprednisolone) of corticosteroids or the standard doses (SD, 1.5mg/kg/day or more of methylprednisolone) at discretion of treating physician. The primary endpoint was the mortality between both cohorts and secondary endpoints were the risk of need for mechanical ventilation (MV) or death and the risk of developing a severe ARDS. RESULTS: 573 patients were included: 428 (74.7%) men, with a median (IQR) age of 64 (54-73) years. In HD cohort, a worse baseline respiratory situation was observed and male sex, older age and comorbidities were significantly more common. After adjusting by baseline characteristics, HD were associated with a higher mortality than SD (adjusted-OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.58-3.83, p<0.001) and with an increased risk of needing MV or death (adjusted-OR 2.50, p=0.001). Conversely, the risk of developing a severe ARDS was similar between groups. Interaction analysis showed that HD increased mortality exclusively in elderly patients. CONCLUSION: Our real-world experience advises against exceeding 1-1.5mg/kg/day of corticosteroids for severe COVID-19 with an ARDS, especially in older subjects. This reinforces the rationale of modulating rather than suppressing immune responses in these patients."
Willingness of Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis to Use Telemedicine Amid Sars-CoV-2 Outbreak,"BACKGROUND: There is no report yet on the application of telemedicine in orthopedic practice in Japan. With a focus on patients with KOA, we investigated the willingness of patients to use telemedicine by assessing factors such as the patient’s age, smartphone possession, hospital visiting time, and severity of KOA. METHODS: Data of patients who regularly consulted orthopedic surgeons at our institutions from April 2020 to June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed using an electronic medical database. The patients were diagnosed with KOA according to clinical and radiological findings, according to the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification. included were patients with KOA with KL classification above grade 2. All patients were asked: 1) whether they were willing to use telemedicine (Yes or No), 2) the reason why they answered Yes, 3) the reason why they answered No, 4) if they possessed a smartphone, 5) their numeric rating scale for pain at their last outpatient visit after the Sars-CoV-2 epidemic emerged, and 6) the time required for visiting hospital from their house. Patients were stratified into 2 groups depending on whether they answered Yes (Group Y) or No (group N). Comparisons between the groups concerning smartphone possession, NRS pain, hospital visiting times, and distribution of KL grade were made. RESULTS: Only 36.7% of the patients with KOA said they were willing to use telemedicine. The average age of group Y was significantly younger than that of group N (67.9 ± 9.1 vs 73.1 ± 8.0, P = 0.0026) and the cutoff age was 70.0 years. In addition, the rate of smartphone possession was significantly higher in group Y than in group N (82.5% vs 34.5%, P < 0.001). Hospital visit times and the severity of KOA did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: Age is a barrier to the adoption of telemedicine."
Clinical implications of rapid ePlex® Respiratory Pathogen Panel testing compared to laboratory-developed real-time PCR,"Rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections is of great importance for adequate isolation and treatment. Due to the batch-wise testing, laboratory-developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (LDT) often result in a time to result of one day. Here, LDT was compared with rapid ePlex® Respiratory Pathogen (RP) Panel testing of GenMark Diagnostics (Carlsbad, CA, USA) with regard to time to result, installed isolation precautions, and antibacterial/antiviral treatment. Between January and March 2017, 68 specimens of 64 patients suspected of an acute respiratory infection were tested with LDT and the ePlex® RP panel. The time to result was calculated as the time between sample reception and result reporting. Information regarding isolation and antibacterial/antiviral treatment was obtained from the patient records. Thirty specimens tested LDT positive (47%) and 29 ePlex® RP panel positive (45%). The median time to result was 27.1 h (range 6.5–96.6) for LDT versus 3.4 h (range 1.5–23.6) for the RP panel, p-value < 0.001. In 14 out of 30 patients, isolation was discontinued based on the ePlex® RP panel results, saving 21 isolation days. ePlex® RP panel test results were available approximately one day ahead of the LDT results in the 19 patients receiving antiviral/antibacterial treatment. In addition, two bacterial pathogens, not requested by the physician, were detected using the RP panel. Analysis of respiratory infections with the ePlex® RP panel resulted in a significant decrease in time to result, enabling a reduction in isolation days in half of the patients. Furthermore, syndromic RP panel testing increased the identification of causative pathogens."
A Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) viral vaccine expressing nucleoprotein is immunogenic but fails to confer protection against lethal disease,"Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a severe tick-borne disease, endemic in many countries in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Asia. Between 15–70% of reported cases are fatal with no approved vaccine available. In the present study, the attenuated poxvirus vector, Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara, was used to develop a recombinant candidate vaccine expressing the CCHF virus nucleoprotein. Cellular and humoral immunogenicity was confirmed in 2 mouse strains, including type I interferon receptor knockout mice, which are susceptible to CCHF disease. Despite the immune responses generated post-immunisation, the vaccine failed to protect animals from lethal disease in a challenge model."
The Lourdes Pilgrimage and the Impact on Pilgrim Quality of Life,"Lourdes, France, is a major site of pilgrimage, particularly for Roman Catholics with illness. The direct impact of pilgrimage on pilgrim quality of life (QOL) has not previously been measured. The present study aimed to measure the impact of pilgrimage to Lourdes on QOL in self-defined “sick pilgrims”. The standardised EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire measured two aspects of QOL, namely a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of self-rated health and an Index Value Score (IVS) of the five dimensions of QOL, in a group of pilgrims, before (Q1), immediately after (Q2) and two months after (Q3) return from pilgrimage to Lourdes. A total of 93 pilgrims responded at time Q1, 71 at Q2 and 64 at Q3. The VAS scores of self-rated health showed statistically significant improvement at Q2 (p = 0.04), although this was not sustained at Q3. The IVS Scores showed no significant differences at Q2 or Q3. However, at Q2, 67.6% of pilgrims reported their self-rated QOL as “much better” or “better”, and this was maintained in 54.7% at Q3. Pilgrims identified “spiritual and religious aspects of pilgrimage”, “a sense of togetherness” and “spiritual healing” as having the most significant impact on their QOL. The Lourdes pilgrimage had a statistically significant positive impact on the immediate post-pilgrimage VAS scores of QOL of “sick pilgrims”, but this was not sustained two months following pilgrimage. The IVS scores were unchanged. Pilgrims identified beneficial holistic, spiritual and communal aspects of the pilgrimage experience."
Identifying infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 by ultra-sensitive SnS(2) SERS biosensors with capillary effect,"The current COVID-19 pandemic urges us to develop ultra-sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates to identify the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 virions in actual environments. Here, a micrometer-sized spherical SnS(2) structure with the hierarchical nanostructure of ""nano-canyon” morphology was developed as semiconductor-based SERS substrate, and it exhibited an extremely low limit of detection of 10(−13) M for methylene blue, which is one of the highest sensitivities among the reported pure semiconductor-based SERS substrates. Such ultra-high SERS sensitivity originated from the synergistic enhancements of the molecular enrichment caused by capillary effect and the charge transfer chemical enhancement boosted by the lattice strain and sulfur vacancies. The novel two-step SERS diagnostic route based on the ultra-sensitive SnS(2) substrate was presented to diagnose the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 through the identification standard of SERS signals for SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RNA, which could accurately identify non-infectious lysed SARS-CoV-2 virions in actual environments, whereas the current PCR methods cannot."
SARS-CoV-2 infection and a subsequent secondary atrophy/atresia of one of the umbilical arteries,
Screening and druggability analysis of some plant metabolites against SARS-CoV-2: An integrative computational approach,"The sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus has caused a global concern due to its infection rate and mortality. Despite extensive research, there are still no specific drugs or vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate some plant-based active compounds for drug candidacy against SARS-CoV-2 by using virtual screening methods and various computational analyses. A total of 27 plant metabolites were screened against SARS-CoV-2 main protease proteins (MPP), Nsp9 RNA binding protein, spike receptor binding domain, spike ecto-domain and HR2 domain using a molecular docking approach. Four metabolites, i.e., asiatic acid, avicularin, guajaverin, and withaferin showed maximum binding affinity with all key proteins in terms of lowest global binding energy. The crucial binding sites and drug surface hotspots were unravelled for each viral protein. The top candidates were further employed for ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) analysis to investigate their drug profiles. Results suggest that none of the compounds render any undesirable consequences that could reduce their drug likeness properties. The analysis of toxicity pattern revealed no significant tumorigenic, mutagenic, irritating, or reproductive effects by the compounds. However, withaferin was comparatively toxic among the top four candidates with considerable cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Most of the target class by top drug candidates belonged to enzyme groups (e.g. oxidoreductases hydrolases, phosphatases). Moreover, results of drug similarity prediction revealed two approved structural analogs of Asiatic acid i.e. Hydrocortisone (DB00741) (previously used for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS) and Dinoprost-tromethamine (DB01160) from DrugBank. In addition, two other biologically active compounds, Mupirocin (DB00410) and Simvastatin (DB00641) could be an option for the treatment of viral infections. The study may pave the way to develop effective medications and preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2. Due to the encouraging results, we highly recommend further in vivo trials for the experimental validation of our findings."
Women’s Lived Experiences with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF): How TANF Can Better Support Women’s Wellbeing and Reduce Intimate Partner Violence,"Women experiencing poverty are more likely to face intimate partner violence (IPV), poor health, and stigma. IPV survivors are overrepresented among those who receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a conditional cash program serving families experiencing poverty. More generous TANF policies may be protective against IPV, but a greater insight into TANF’s effect could be gleaned through a contemporaneous study that examines intersecting determinants of wellbeing and engages community interpretation of findings. Using an adapted Family Stress Model framework and analyzing data through an intersectional and community-based lens, we explore the impact of TANF on women’s wellbeing through in-depth, semi-structured interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic with 13 women who had TANF experience in three U.S. states. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis in MAXQDA and researchers facilitated three member-checking events to enhance validity of result interpretation. Four themes emerged: (1) Low cash and conditional benefits provided limited short-term “relief” but contributed to poverty and hard choices; (2) TANF benefit levels and conditions increased women’s dependence on others, straining relationships; (3) Women undertook extraordinary measures to access TANF, largely to fulfill their roles as mothers; and (4) TANF stigma creates psychological stress, differentially experienced by African Americans. Increasing TANF cash benefits and other cash transfers for those experiencing poverty, adopting solely state funded TANF programs, increasing funding for TANF administration, addressing TANF stigma and racialized narratives, and allowing optional child support participation or a larger “pass-through” of child support are important steps toward making TANF more protective against IPV."
Introduction: Genome Biology.,
A Framework for Online Experimenter-Moderated Looking-Time Studies Assessing Infants’ Linguistic Knowledge,"Online data collection methods pose unique challenges and opportunities for infant researchers. Looking-time measures require relative timing precision to link eye-gaze behavior to stimulus presentation, particularly for tasks that require visual stimuli to be temporally linked to auditory stimuli, which may be disrupted when studies are delivered online. Concurrently, by widening potential geographic recruitment areas, online data collection may also provide an opportunity to diversify participant samples that are not possible given in-lab data collection. To date, there is limited information about these potential challenges and opportunities. In Study 1, twenty-one 23- to 26-month-olds participated in an experimenter-moderated looking-time paradigm that was administered via the video conferencing platform Zoom, attempting to recreate in-lab data collection using a looking-while-listening paradigm. Data collected virtually approximated results from in-lab samples of familiar word recognition, after minimal corrections to account for timing variability. We also found that the procedures were robust to a wide range of internet speeds, increasing the range of potential participants. However, despite the use of an online task, the participants in Study 1 were demographically unrepresentative, as typically observed with in-person studies in our geographic area. The potentially wider reach of online data collection methods presents an opportunity to recruit larger, more representative samples than those traditionally found in lab-based infant research, which is crucial for conducting generalizable human-subjects research. In Study 2, microtargeted Facebook advertisements for online studies were directed at two geographic locations that are comparable in population size but vary widely in demographic and socioeconomic factors. We successfully elicited sign-up responses from caregivers in neighborhoods that are far more diverse than the local University community in which we conduct our in-person studies. The current studies provide a framework for infancy researchers to conduct remote eye-gaze studies by identifying best practices for recruitment, design, and analysis. Moderated online data collection can provide considerable benefits to the diversification of infant research, with minimal impact on the timing precision and usability of the resultant data."
COVID-19 innovations in medication for addiction treatment at a Skid Row syringe exchange,"Syringe exchange patients in Los Angeles’ Skid Row endure conditions such as deep poverty, polysubstance use, underlying health problems, and living on the streets or in homeless encampments/shelters that make them uniquely vulnerable to acquiring and dying from COVID-19. In this commentary, we discuss two essential changes that Homeless Health Care Los Angeles (HHCLA) made to modify existing medication for addiction treatment (MAT) services to address the specific treatment needs of this high-risk population during COVID-19. First, HHCLA implemented a novel “telephone booth” model that allowed socially distanced on-site “face-to-face” treatment of syringe exchange patients; this model helped us to overcome the inherent challenges of using traditional telemedicine approaches (e.g., video, mobile telephone) with this disadvantaged patient population. Second, HHCLA transitioned from on-site direct dispensing of MAT medications in our providers’ offices to a less contact- and time-intensive “coordinated pharmacy” model that allowed patients the freedom to obtain MAT medications off-site from participating pharmacies. Our data indicate that implementing these COVID-19-related changes effectively maintained patient enrollment and engagement in MAT—illuminating new, potentially effective models for delivering MAT that meet the critical health and safety needs of syringe exchange patients following COVID-19."
Post-acute care management of a patient with COVID-19 using remote cardiorespiratory monitoring,"Hospital discharge planning can be complex and hospital space is often limited. Patients, including those with COVID-19, can have prolonged symptoms after discharge and often require ongoing monitoring. Furthermore, prolonging hospital stays primarily for monitoring can expose patients to iatrogenic and infectious risks. The patient's overall condition and their home support system factor into the decisions of when and where to discharge patients. Innovations in remote patient monitoring (RPM) now allow for more options in the discharge process. This case report presents a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia where RPM was used at discharge to improve home monitoring and clinical follow-up. Additional experience with RPM is necessary to refine its role in post-acute care monitoring."
Health-Promoting Properties of Medicinal Mushrooms and Their Bioactive Compounds for the COVID-19 Era—An Appraisal: Do the Pro-Health Claims Measure Up?,"Many mushroom species are consumed as food, while significant numbers are also utilised medicinally. Mushrooms are rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds. A growing body of in vitro, in vivo, and human research has revealed their therapeutic potentials, which include such properties as anti-pathogenic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, gut microbiota enhancement, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 specificity. The uses of medicinal mushrooms (MMs) as extracts in nutraceuticals and other functional food and health products are burgeoning. COVID-19 presents an opportunity to consider how, and if, specific MM compounds might be utilised therapeutically to mitigate associated risk factors, reduce disease severity, and support recovery. As vaccines become a mainstay, MMs may have the potential as an adjunct therapy to enhance immunity. In the context of COVID-19, this review explores current research about MMs to identify the key properties claimed to confer health benefits. Considered also are barriers or limitations that may impact general recommendations on MMs as therapy. It is contended that the extraction method used to isolate bioactive compounds must be a primary consideration for efficacious targeting of physiological endpoints. Mushrooms commonly available for culinary use and obtainable as a dietary supplement for medicinal purposes are included in this review. Specific properties related to these mushrooms have been considered due to their potential protective and mediating effects on human exposure to the SARS CoV-2 virus and the ensuing COVID-19 disease processes."

"Movember in a pandemic - it matters, more than ever","Dear Editor, in recent years there has been an increase in the number of new cases of cancer. This increase, in part, is closely related to the increase in average life expectancy, as well as more accurate diagnostic techniques and well-defined screening programs. [...]."
The Pathogenic Role of Interferons in the Hyperinflammatory Response on Adult-Onset Still’s Disease and Macrophage Activation Syndrome: Paving the Way towards New Therapeutic Targets,"Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology affecting young adults, which is burdened by life-threatening complications, mostly macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Interferons (IFNs) are signalling molecules that mediate a variety of biological functions from defence against viral infections, to antitumor and immunomodulatory effects. These molecules have been classified into three major types: IFN I, IFN II, IFN III, presenting specific characteristics and functions. In this work, we reviewed the role of IFNs on AOSD and MAS, focusing on their pathogenic role in promoting the hyperinflammatory response and as new possible therapeutic targets. In fact, both preclinical and clinical observations suggested that these molecules could promote the hyperinflammatory response in MAS during AOSD. Furthermore, the positive results of inhibiting IFN-γ in primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may provide a solid rationale to arrange further clinical studies, paving the way for reducing the high mortality rate in MAS during AOSD."
Networks and Emotions in Cooperative Work: A Quasi-Experimental Study in University Nursing and Computer Engineering Students,"University students establish networks that impact on their behavior. Social Network Analysis (SNA) allows us to analyze the reticular structures formed and find patterns of interaction between university students. The main objective of this study was to observe the impact of interdisciplinary collaborative work between nursing and computer engineering students on the collaboration and friendship networks, emotions and performance of the participants. It is a quasi-experimental descriptive study with pre- and post-intervention measurements. The contact networks analyzed showed an increase in density in the post-intervention period. The most central people in the network corresponded with those who considered positive emotions most in their academic environment, while the less central people coincided with those who highlighted negative emotions. Academic performance was only significantly associated in the collaboration network, between this and OutdegreeN. This study shows the impact of interdisciplinary activities on teaching methodologies and the repercussions of emotions on curricular activity."
Vaccination for Justice-Involved Youth,"Justice-involved youth are at increased risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, and structural barriers may limit their access to vaccination. We implemented a COVID-19 vaccination initiative for justice-involved youth residing at the county juvenile detention center and enrolled in local community-based monitoring programs. Our overarching goal was to increase COVID-19 vaccine access and uptake for justice-involved youth in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Our efforts incorporated: a virtual forum with youth, guardians, and community partners; one-on-one outreach to guardians; motivational interviewing with youth; and coordination with organizational leaders. We collaborated with a multidisciplinary medical team to offer individualized education and counseling to parents and youth expressing vaccine hesitancy. We developed a logistical framework to ensure complete COVID-19 vaccination series for all youth, including centralized tracking and implementation of multiple community-based vaccine clinics. Through our initiative, 31 justice-involved youth have received at least 1 dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 50 doses have been administered as a result of this initiative. This work has reaffirmed hypothesized barriers to vaccine access among justice-involved youth, including limited parental involvement, inadequate transportation, vaccine misinformation, and distrust rooted in histories of medical mistreatment of communities of color. Best practices for promoting equitable vaccination efforts among vulnerable subgroups include partnering closely with diverse community members; offering individualized, strengths-based counseling on vaccine safety, efficacy, and importance; and demonstrating provider trustworthiness by recognizing histories of oppression."
Pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced ARDS: implications for an aging population,"The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic has elicited a swift response by the scientific community to elucidate the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2-induced lung injury and develop effective therapeutics. Clinical data indicate that severe COVID-19 most commonly manifests as viral pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a clinical entity mechanistically understood best in the context of influenza A virus-induced pneumonia. Similar to influenza, advanced age has emerged as the leading host risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. In this review we connect the current understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and host response to the clinical presentation of COVID-19, borrowing concepts from influenza A virus-induced ARDS pathogenesis and discussing how these ideas inform our evolving understanding of COVID-19-induced ARDS. We also consider important differences between COVID-19 and influenza, mainly COVID-19's protean clinical presentation and associated lymphopenia, the contrasting role of interferon-γ in mediating the host immune response to these viruses, and SARS-CoV-2's tropism for vascular endothelial cells, commenting on the potential limitations of influenza as a model for COVID-19. Finally, we explore hallmarks of aging that could explain the association between advanced age and susceptibility to severe COVID-19."
"Inequality, role reversal and cooperation in multiple group membership settings","We investigate the role of endowment inequality in a local and global public goods setting with multiple group membership and examine the effect of temporal role reversal on cooperation decisions. Subjects can contribute to a global public good which benefits all subjects and two local public goods which benefit only subjects of either their own group or the group of the other endowment type. Endowment inequality per-se decreases contributions of subjects with a high endowment to the global public good, but increases cooperation of subjects with a low endowment on their local public good, thereby aggravating income disparities. Exogenously induced role reversal for several periods affects cooperation behavior of subjects with a high endowment positively and induces them to contribute more to the global good. Cooperation in unequal environments thus appears to be more stable when all parties have experienced the public goods game from the disadvantageous perspective.

Lesión renal aguda en COVID-19: puesta al día y revisión de la literatura,"Los coronavirus humanos son virus respiratorios que se asocian a varias patologías respiratorias como el Síndrome Respiratorio Agudo Severo y el Síndrome Respiratorio del Medio Oriente. Esto ha puesto a esta familia de virus en el centro de atención de la comunidad científica debido a la alta patogenicidad en humanos y más ahora con la nueva pandemia por la enfermedad por coronavirus del 2019 (COVID-19). La COVID-19 se manifiesta principalmente como enfermedad respiratoria aguda con compromiso respiratorio bajo, pero puede afectar múltiples órganos como lo es el riñón lo cual a conlleva a peores desenlaces. En este manuscrito revisaremos el compromiso renal por los diferentes coronavirus, en especial en la COVID-19, al igual que las terapias que juegan algún papel en el tratamiento de ésta. [[[en]]]Abstract Human coronaviruses are respiratory viruses that are associated with various respiratory diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. This high pathogenicity puts coronaviruses in the spotlight of the scientific community, and due to the new coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19). Although COVID-19 manifests mainly as an acute respiratory disease with low respiratory compromise, it can also affect multiple organs such as the kidney, which leads to worse outcomes. In this article, a review is presented on the renal compromise due to coronaviruses, especially in COVID-19, and the therapies that have a role in its treatment."
Taizhou’s COVID-19 prevention and control experience with telemedicine features,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world. As of May 30, 2020, a total of 84 568 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been recorded in China, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.5%. Taizhou is a prefecture-level city in Zhejiang Province. A total of 146 cases were diagnosed in this epidemic, with a fatality rate of 0%. This condition is due to the establishment of an “Internet +” diagnosis and treatment model based on online medical application (APP), telemedicine, WeChat service, and consultation hotline in Taizhou. Taizhou led in opening the “COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment Special Line” in China, which is conducive to pre-hospital screening, suppressing social panic, and clinical support. Hospitals also carried out related online lectures and popularization of science. We summarize Taizhou’s COVID-19 prevention and control experience with telemedicine features, with a view to providing reference for the control of the epidemic at home and abroad."
A multi-stage virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs reveals potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global health emergency. Repurposing of approved pharmaceutical drugs for COVID-19 treatment represents an attractive approach to quickly identify promising drug candidates. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is responsible for the maturation of viral functional proteins making it a key antiviral target. Based on the recently revealed crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), we herein describe a multi-stage virtual screening protocol including pharmacophore screening, molecular docking and protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (PLIF) post-docking filtration for efficient enrichment of potent SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors. Potential hits, along with a cocrystallized control were further studied via molecular dynamics. A 150-ns production trajectory was followed by RMSD, free energy calculation, and H-bond analysis for each compound. The applied virtual screening protocol led to identification of five FDA-approved drugs with promising binding modes to key subsites of the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The identified compounds belong to different pharmaceutical classes, including several protease inhibitors, antineoplastic agents and a natural flavonoid. The drug candidates discovered in this study present a potential extension of the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors that have been identified using other virtual screening protocols and may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment."
Evaluation of a healthcare walk-in centre in an immigrant-dense area from the perspective of Swedish-born patients,"AIM: This study evaluates a healthcare walk-in centre in an immigrant-dense area from the perspective of Swedish-born patients. BACKGROUND: The studied healthcare centre started a walk-in centre to increase healthcare accessibility for immigrants. This form of care is not primarily for Swedish-born patients although everyone is welcome. For this reason, it is important to evaluate the walk-in centre from different perspectives: the healthcare workers, the immigrant patients, and in this study focusing on the Swedish-born patients. METHOD: This qualitative exploratory study used content analysis to analyse data collected from semi-structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews were held with 12 purposively sampled Swedish-born patients visiting a healthcare centre in Sweden. FINDINGS: Most informants characterised the care they received as professional and timely and noted that accessibility was the main reason they sought care at the walk-in centre. In addition, they noted that being able to seek care on the day they want creates a feeling of security. However, Swedish-born informants seemed to prefer a traditional healthcare centre, although they viewed the walk-in centre as legitimate because everyone has access to it. CONCLUSION: As the walk-in centre was perceived as having good accessibility, participants experienced that they could easily receive help for minor health problems. However, they also identified several ways the walk-in centre could be improved. For example, some participants preferred to remain outside while awaiting their turn to see a healthcare provider and wanted immigrant patients to leave their relatives at home when possible to minimise the risk of spreading infection. In addition, some participants thought a triage system could be implemented so that more severe cases could advance more quickly in the queue. The homogeneous sample of informants raises questions about whether this healthcare model is indeed accessible to everyone."
STIG study: real-world data of long-term outcomes of adults with Pompe disease under enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa,"BACKGROUND: Pompe disease is one of the few neuromuscular diseases with an approved drug therapy, which has been available since 2006. Our study aimed to determine the real-world long-term efficacy and safety of alglucosidase alfa. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study (NCT02824068) collected data from adult Pompe disease patients receiving ERT for at least 3 years. Demographics and baseline characteristics, muscle strength, lung function (FVC), walking capability (6MWT), and safety were assessed once a year. Evaluation was done on the group and individual levels, using quantitative linear models (t test) and general univariate linear models (ANOVA). FINDINGS: Sixty-eight adult Pompe disease patients from four countries (Spain, Taiwan, Italy, Germany (STIG)) participated. The mean follow-up was 7.03 years ± 2.98. At group level in all outcome measures, an initial improvement followed by a secondary decline was observed. After 10 years, the 6MWT(%pred) showed the most sustained positive effect (p = 0.304). The MRC(%max) remained stable with a mild decline (p = 0.131), however, FVC(%pred) deteriorated significantly (p < 0.001) by 14.93% over 10 years of ERT. The progression rate of FVC(%pred) under ERT could be explained in most of the patients (83.5%) by the disease severity at baseline. Furthermore, our study shows a decline in the FVC combined with an increase in non-invasive and invasive ventilation requirements in adult Pompe disease patients over time. CONCLUSIONS: The STIG real-world study confirms an initial efficacy of ERT in the first years with a secondary sustained decline in multiple outcome measures. Further efforts are required to establish a more valid long-term monitoring and improved therapies. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00415-021-10409-9."
Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression Among Medical Students During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study,"PURPOSE: The Covid-19 pandemic is a public health emergency with both physical and mental health risks. Medical students have baseline elevated rates of anxiety, depression and burnout. As such, they may be especially susceptible to the psychological stresses of Covid-19. The current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among United States medical students during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data as well as the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. The survey was administered from April 13, 2020 to April 28, 2020 amidst the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 1,428 students from 40 US medical schools completed the survey. From those surveyed, 30.6% and 24.3% of respondents screened positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Median GAD-7 scores were higher among females (7.0 vs 5.0, P < .00001), pre-clinical students (7.0 vs 6.0, P < .00004), and those with a friend or relative diagnosed with Covid-19 (7.0 vs 6.0, P=.001). Median PHQ-9 scores were higher among females (6.0 vs 4.0, P < .00001) and pre-clinical students (6.0 vs 4.0, P < .00001). CONCLUSION: When compared to previous medical student studies, these results are 61% higher for anxiety and 70% higher for depression during the Covid-19 era. The current study suggests that there should be a heightened awareness of and sensitivity to student’s mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic with certain cohorts at greater potential risk."
Twenty years of integrated disease surveillance and response in Sub-Saharan Africa: challenges and opportunities for effective management of infectious disease epidemics,"INTRODUCTION: This systematic review aimed to analyse the performance of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and how its implementation has embraced advancement in information technology, big data analytics techniques and wealth of data sources. METHODS: HINARI, PubMed, and advanced Google Scholar databases were searched for eligible articles. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols. RESULTS: A total of 1,809 articles were identified and screened at two stages. Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 were country-specific, seven covered the SSA region, and three covered 3–4 countries. Twenty-six studies assessed the IDSR core functions, 43 the support functions, while 24 addressed both functions. Most of the studies involved Tanzania (9), Ghana (6) and Uganda (5). The routine Health Management Information System (HMIS), which collects data from health care facilities, has remained the primary source of IDSR data. However, the system is characterised by inadequate data completeness, timeliness, quality, analysis and utilisation, and lack of integration of data from other sources. Under-use of advanced and big data analytical technologies in performing disease surveillance and relating multiple indicators minimises the optimisation of clinical and practice evidence-based decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that most countries in SSA rely mainly on traditional indicator-based disease surveillance utilising data from healthcare facilities with limited use of data from other sources. It is high time that SSA countries consider and adopt multi-sectoral, multi-disease and multi-indicator platforms that integrate other sources of health information to provide support to effective detection and prompt response to public health threats."
Existing Crisis Standards of Care Triage Protocols May Not Significantly Differentiate Between Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Who Require Intensive Care,"OBJECTIVES: To determine how several existing crisis standards of care triage protocols would have distinguished between patients with coronavirus disease 2019 requiring intensive care. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single urban academic medical center. PATIENTS: One-hundred twenty patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who required intensive care and mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The characteristics of each patient at the time of ICU triage were used to determine how patients would have been prioritized using four crisis standards of care protocols. The vast majority of patients in the cohort would have been in the highest priority group using a triage protocol focusing on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment alone. Prioritization based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 1-year life expectancy would have resulted in only slightly more differentiation between patients. Prioritization based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 5-year life expectancy would have added significant additional differentiation depending on how priority groups were defined. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable controversy regarding the use of criteria other than prognosis for short-term survival in initial allocation of critical care resources under crisis standards of care triage protocols. To the extent that initial triage protocols would not create sufficient differentiation between patients, effectively resulting in a first-come, first-served initial allocation of resources, it is important to focus on how resources would be reallocated in the event of ongoing scarcity."
34. Long-term clinical outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection include persistent symptoms and cardiovascular disease beyond 3 months post-infection,"BACKGROUND: The long-term health effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. We evaluated health and healthcare usage after SARS-CoV-2 infection via surveys and longitudinal electronic medical record (EMR) review within the Military Health System (MHS). METHODS: We studied MHS beneficiaries enrolled in the Epidemiology, Immunology, and Clinical Characteristics of Emerging Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential (EPICC) cohort from March to December 2020. COVID-19 illness symptom severity and duration were derived from surveys initiated in late 2020. In addition, multi-year healthcare encounter history before and after onset of COVID-19 symptoms was collected from the MHS EMR. Odds of organ-system clinical diagnoses within the 3 months pre- and post-symptom onset were calculated using generalized linear models, controlling for age, sex, and race, and including participant as a random effect. RESULTS: 1,015 participants were included who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, symptomatic, and had 3-month follow-up data available in the EMR (Table 1). 625 of these participants had survey data collected more than 28 days post-symptom onset, among whom 17% and 6% reported persistent symptoms at 28-84 days, and 85+ days, respectively. 9.6% had not resumed normal activities by one month. The most frequently reported symptoms persisting beyond 28 days were dyspnea, loss of smell and/or taste, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (Figure 1A). When compared with the period 61 to 90 days prior to symptom onset, the first month post-symptom onset period was associated with increases of pulmonary (aOR = 57, 95% CI 28-112), renal (aOR = 29, 95% CI 10-84), cardiovascular (aOR = 7, 95% CI 5-11), and neurological diagnoses (aOR = 3, 95% CI 2-4) (Figures 1B and 1C). Cardiovascular disease diagnoses remained elevated through 3 months (aOR = 2, 95% CI 1-3). Table 1. Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2+ EPICC participants, and illness duration among those with 28+ days post-symptom onset survey data collection. [Image: see text] Figure 1 [Image: see text] Fig1A. Symptoms reported by EPICC participants with illnesses longer than 28 days; 1B. Percent of participants with organ system specific diagnoses on each day, 90 days pre- and post-symptom onset; 1C. Odds of organ system specific diagnoses within each month, +/- 3 months of symptom onset, were calculated using generalized linear models, controlling for age, sex, and race and included participants as a random effect. Odds shown are relative to the earliest period included in the model, 61-90 days before onset. CONCLUSION: In this MHS cohort, a significant proportion of participants had persistent symptoms and cardiovascular disease diagnoses 3 months after COVID-19 illness onset. These findings emphasize the long-term morbidity of COVID-19 and the importance of mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infections. Further analyses will evaluate demographic, clinical, and biomarker predictors of medium-to-long term organ-specific post-acute sequelae.

Understanding decisions about antibiotic prescribing in ICU: an application of the Necessity Concerns Framework,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are extensively prescribed in intensive care units (ICUs), yet little is known about how antibiotic-related decisions are made in this setting. We explored how beliefs, perceptions and contextual factors influenced ICU clinicians’ antibiotic prescribing. METHODS: We conducted 4 focus groups and 34 semistructured interviews with clinicians involved in antibiotic prescribing in four English ICUs. Focus groups explored factors influencing prescribing, whereas interviews examined decision-making processes using two clinical vignettes. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, applying the Necessity Concerns Framework. RESULTS: Clinicians’ antibiotic decisions were influenced by their judgement of the necessity for prescribing/not prescribing, relative to their concerns about potential adverse consequences. Antibiotic necessity perceptions were strongly influenced by beliefs that antibiotics would protect patients from deterioration and themselves from the ethical and legal consequences of undertreatment. Clinicians also reported concerns about prescribing antibiotics. These generally centred on antimicrobial resistance; however, protecting the individual patient was prioritised over these societal concerns. Few participants identified antibiotic toxicity concerns as a key influencer. Clinical uncertainty often complicated balancing antibiotic necessity against concerns. Decisions to start or continue antibiotics often represented ‘erring on the side of caution’ as a protective response in uncertainty. This approach was reinforced by previous experiences of negative consequences (‘being burnt’) which motivated prescribing ‘just in case’ of an infection. Prescribing decisions were also context-dependent, exemplified by a lower perceived threshold to prescribe antibiotics out-of-hours, input from external team members and local prescribing norms. CONCLUSION: Efforts to improve antibiotic stewardship should consider clinicians’ desire to protect with a prescription. Rapid molecular microbiology, with appropriate communication, may diminish clinicians’ fears of not prescribing or of using narrower-spectrum antibiotics."
Do economic policy uncertainty and financial development influence the renewable energy consumption levels in China?,"Last few decades, several economic uncertainty challenges have emerged in the energy market. This study newly contributes to existing research by inspecting the asymmetric effect of economic policy uncertainty and financial development on renewable energy consumption in China. We employ a nonlinear ARDL approach by using a time-series dataset spanning from 1990 to 2019. Our symmetric model shows that economic policy uncertainty matters in the short run, as it increases renewable energy consumption while exhibiting a negative impact on renewable energy in long run in China. Our asymmetric results in the short and long run have deviated from the symmetric results. Our asymmetric results of the short and long run are similar in direction but different in magnitude. The results show that positive change in economic policy uncertainty has increased 3.216% and negative change in economic policy uncertainty has decreased 1.461% in renewable energy consumption in long run in China. Financial development does not matter in renewable energy consumption in China. Based on these outcomes, we can draw some robust economic policies in China as well as for other pollutant economies. Policymakers should be made economic policies more predictable in the modern era."
Patient Perception of Physician Attire in the Outpatient Setting During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"INTRODUCTION: In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, physician attire has evolved to incorporate personal protective equipment (PPE). Although PPE is mandated for all healthcare workers, variability exists in choice and availability. The purpose of this study was to determine patient perception of physician attire during the COVID-19 pandemic in an outpatient setting. METHODS: Three hundred sixty-eight patients who presented to our outpatient orthopaedic clinics completed an anonymous survey. In addition to demographic characteristics, patient preferences for attire, PPE, and social distancing were obtained. RESULTS: Scrubs (81%, 298/368) were found to be the most acceptable physician attire. Eye protection (34.2%, 126/368) and gloves (32.6%, 120/368), however, were deemed much less acceptable; 93.5% (344/368) of patients reported that no mask was unacceptable, with 41.0% (151/368) preferring a surgical mask. Predilection for a surgical mask and N95 rose with increasing patient education level. Interestingly, 55.2% (203/368) responded that physicians should stop wearing PPE only when the Center for Disease Control recommends. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the patients found scrubs to be the most acceptable attire in an office-based outpatient setting. Patients also found physician mask-wearing to be important but are less accepting of providers wearing eye and hand protection."
Can R&D investment reduce the impact of COVID‐19 on firm performance?—Evidence from India,"This study examines whether investing in R&D reduces the impact of exogenous shocks like the COVID‐19 on stock market performance and accounting performance of manufacturing firms in India. For the sample of listed manufacturing firms, the paper finds that the firms engaged in R&D activities had lower negative cumulative abnormal return than those firms that did not invest in R&D in the pre‐pandemic period using multiple event windows. The result suggests that R&D investments can lower value erosion for the shareholders during a severe crisis period. Further, using a difference‐in‐difference fixed effects model, the study finds that manufacturing firms engaged in R&D activities in the pre‐pandemic period exhibited higher return on sales and growth of total income during the pandemic quarter vis‐à‐vis the non‐R&D firms. The favorable accounting performance indicates the possibility of firm‐level R&D being associated with the firm's ability to adjust its functioning during a crisis, thereby reducing the effect of the crisis. Finally, the study documents that government intervention to reduce the spread of the virus had a differential impact on firms based on their industry of operation. The findings have implications for investors, corporate managers, and policymakers in India."
"Conflict affected, parallel health systems: challenges to collaboration between ethnic and government health systems in Kayin State, Myanmar","BACKGROUND: Myanmar has had a long history of civil wars with its minority ethnic groups and is yet to see a sustainable peace accord. The conflicts have had a significant impact on health in Myanmar, with ethnic populations experiencing inequitable health outcomes. Consequently, to meet the health needs of ethnic people, Ethnic Health Organisations and Community-Based Health Organisations (EHO/CBHOs) created their own health system. The EHO/CBHO and Government health systems, provided by the Myanmar Ministry of Health and Sports (MoHS), remain parallel, despite both stakeholders discussing unification of the health systems within the context of ongoing but unresolved peace processes. EHO/CBHOs discuss the ‘convergence’ of health systems, whilst the MoHS discuss the integration of health providers under their National Health Plan. METHODS: A qualitative study design was used to explore the challenges to collaboration between EHO/CBHOs and the MoHS in Kayin state, Myanmar. Twelve health workers from different levels of the Karen EHO/CBHO health system were interviewed. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and coded. Data was analysed thematically using the Framework method. Topic guides evolved in an iterative process, as themes emerged inductively from the transcripts. A literature review and observation methods were also utilised to increase validity of the data. RESULTS: The challenges to collaboration were identified in the following five themes: (1) the current situation is not ‘post conflict’ (2) a lack of trust (3) centralised nature of the MoHS (4) lack of EHO/CBHO health worker accreditation (5) the NHP is not implemented in some ethnic areas. CONCLUSIONS: Ultimately, all five challenges to collaboration stem from the lack of peace in Myanmar. The health systems cannot be ‘converged or ‘integrated’ until there is a peace accord which is acceptable to all actors. EHO/CBHOs want a federal political system, where the health system is devolved, equitable and accessible to all ethnic people. External donors should understand this context and remain neutral by supporting all health actors in a conflict sensitive manner."
Effectiveness of using calligraphic activity to treat people with schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial in Southern Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: Prior research has shown preliminary evidence that calligraphy activity improves various body functions and decreases severity of psychotic symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. However, major limitations of earlier studies include small and heterogeneous samples. The current large-scale randomized controlled trial examined effects of calligraphy activity on cognition (including attention), emotions, psychotic symptoms, quality of life, and mood in people with schizophrenia. METHODS: One-hundred-and-fifty patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to the treatment group (receiving calligraphy activity) or the control group (receiving general activity), both of which lasted for 24 weeks (70 minutes per session; one session per week). Assessments were conducted at pretest, posttest, and three-month follow-up. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Chu’s Attention Test, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, World Health Questionnaire on the Quality of Life-Brief Form, and Visual Analogue Scale were used. RESULTS: Improved cognition and attention were found in both groups, although no group effects were shown. The treatment group appeared to show lower severity of positive symptoms at follow-up than posttest, whereas the control group appeared to show the opposite pattern. Improved mood was found in the treatment group. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence regarding effects of calligraphy activity on increasing cognition and potentially decreasing severity of positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Calligraphy activity can be incorporated in clinical occupational therapy and may be provided to supplement medication treatment.

Human Coronaviruses: A Review of Virus–Host Interactions,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known respiratory pathogens associated with a range of respiratory outcomes. In the past 14 years, the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have thrust HCoVs into spotlight of the research community due to their high pathogenicity in humans. The study of HCoV-host interactions has contributed extensively to our understanding of HCoV pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss some of the recent findings of host cell factors that might be exploited by HCoVs to facilitate their own replication cycle. We also discuss various cellular processes, such as apoptosis, innate immunity, ER stress response, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway that may be modulated by HCoVs."
In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Peptides Obtained by Tryptic Shaving of Surface Proteins of Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9,"Streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic acid bacterium widely used in the dairy industry, is consumed regularly by a significant proportion of the population. Some strains show in vitro anti-inflammatory activity which is not fully understood. We hypothesized that peptides released from the surface proteins of this bacterium during digestion could be implied in this activity. Consequently, we prepared a peptide hydrolysate by shaving and hydrolysis of surface proteins using trypsin, and the origin of peptides was checked by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Most of the identified peptides originated from bacterial cell surface proteins. The anti-inflammatory activity of peptide hydrolysate was investigated under inflammatory conditions in two cell models. Peptide hydrolysate significantly decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human colon epithelial HT-29 cells. It also reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-1β and the protein expression levels of Pro-IL-1β and COX-2 in LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophages. The results showed that peptides released from bacterial surface proteins by a pancreatic protease could therefore participate in an anti-inflammatory activity of S. thermophilus LMD-9 and could prevent low-grade inflammation."
Are non-face-to-face interactions an effective strategy for maintaining mental and physical health?,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to social isolation measures, forcing many people to stay indoors, stop daily outdoor activities, and limit face-to-face social interactions with friends, colleagues, and family. This study aimed to identify if non-face-to-face interaction affects depressive symptoms and frailty in older adults. METHODS: We included 3834 older adults (age: 71.1 ± 6.9 [mean ± standard deviation] years; range: 60–96 years; 2153 women) from the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology–Study of Geriatric Syndromes. Interaction status was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Participants were categorized into: “both interactions” (both face-to-face and non-face-to-face interactions), “face-to-face only” (only face-to-face interactions), “non-face-to-face only” (only non-face-to-face interactions), “no interactions” (neither face-to-face nor non-face-to-face interactions) groups. Depressive symptoms and frailty were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and Kihon Checklist, respectively. RESULTS: Potential confounding factors-adjusted odds ratios for both, face-to-face only and non-face-to-face only groups for developing depressive symptoms were 0.39 (95%CI, 0.26–0.57; p<0.001), 0.56 (95%CI, 0.38–0.84; p=0.004), and 0.51 (95%CI, 0.27–0.96; p=0.038), respectively, and those for development of frailty were 0.44 (95%CI, 0.30–0.65; p<0.001), 0.59 (95%CI, 0.39–0.87; p=0.008), and 0.63 (95%CI, 0.34–1.15; p=0.128), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that non-face-to-face interactions are also important in preventing the deterioration of mental health, which is a concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, non-face-to-face interactions alone may not be sufficient to maintain physical health, and it is important to maintain opportunities for face-to-face interaction among older adults, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Perceptions by early career tropical researchers on the impact of COVID‐19 six months into the pandemic,"The impacts of COVID‐19 on early career tropical researchers are diverse and complex, including lack of funding opportunities, limitations to conducting fieldwork in remote places, reduced collaborations and networking, and difficulties when living and collecting data abroad. Here, we examine the current and future impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic on this population through a survey of 213 students and early career tropical researchers from around the world. As of September 2020, 55% of participants had already experienced financial repercussions due to the pandemic. Future worries were diverse and included equal concern regarding advancement (collaborations and networking), job uncertainty, fieldwork, and funding, as well as mental health concerns. Successful strategies to support student and early career researchers with regards to the pandemic should include mentoring from those in more advanced career positions on how to reframe research that is no longer feasible to complete as originally intended. Additionally, those responsible for hiring decisions should not penalize applicants for gaps in productivity during this time."
Prepared and highly committed despite the risk of COVID-19 infection: a cross-sectional survey of primary care physicians’ concerns and coping strategies in Singapore,"BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians (PCPs) are first points-of-contact between suspected cases and the healthcare system in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study examines PCPs’ concerns, impact on personal lives and work, and level of pandemic preparedness in the context of COVID-19 in Singapore. We also examine factors and coping strategies that PCPs have used to manage stress during the outbreak. METHODS: Two hundred and sixteen PCPs actively practicing in either a public or private clinic were cluster sampled via email invitation from three primary care organizations in Singapore from 6th to 29th March 2020. Participants completed a cross-sectional online questionnaire consisting of items on work- and non-work-related concerns, impact on personal and work life, perceived pandemic preparedness, stress-reduction factors, and personal coping strategies related to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 158 questionnaires were usable for analyses. PCPs perceived themselves to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection (89.9%), and a source of risk (74.7%) and concern (71.5%) to loved ones. PCPs reported acceptance of these risks (91.1%) and the need to care for COVID-19 patients (85.4%). Overall perceived pandemic preparedness was extremely high (75.9 to 89.9%). PCPs prioritized availability of personal protective equipment, strict infection prevention guidelines, accessible information about COVID-19, and well-being of their colleagues and family as the most effective stress management factors. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs continue to serve willingly on the frontlines of this pandemic despite the high perception of risk to themselves and loved ones. Healthcare organizations should continue to support PCPs by managing both their psychosocial (e.g. stress management) and professional (e.g. pandemic preparedness) needs.

"Allergic Reactions to Current Available COVID-19 Vaccinations: Pathophysiology, Causality, and Therapeutic Considerations","Vaccines constitute the most effective medications in public health as they control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases and reduce mortality. Similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination. While most reactions are neither frequent nor serious, anaphylactic reactions are potentially life-threatening allergic reactions that are encountered rarely, but can cause serious complications. The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem from activation of mast cells via Fcε receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type IV allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against COVID-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. These considerations include: The incidence of allergic reactions and deaths under investigation with the available vaccines, application of vaccination in patients with mast cell disease, patients who developed an allergy during the first dose, vasovagal symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions, the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and questions arising in managing of this current ordeal. Careful vaccine-safety surveillance over time, in conjunction with the elucidation of mechanisms of adverse events across different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, will contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy. Allergists’ expertise in proper diagnosis and treatment of allergic reactions is vital for the screening of high-risk individuals."
Population-Based Incidence of Human Metapneumovirus in Hospitalized Children,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in children. Population-based incidence rates and comprehensive clinical characterizations of disease have not been established. METHODS: We conducted population-based prospective surveillance for HMPV in two U.S. counties among children <5 years hospitalized with ARI or fever for two years. Nasal/throat swabs were tested for HMPV by real-time RT-PCR and genotyped. RESULTS: Forty-two of 1104 (3.8%) children tested positive for HMPV. The overall annual rate of HMPV-associated hospitalizations per 1000 children <5 years was 1.2 (95%CI 0.9–1.6). This rate was highest in infants 0–5 months (4.9/1000 [95%CI 2.9–7.2]), followed by children 6–11 months (2.9/1000 [95%CI 1.4–4.7]). The annual rate of HMPV-associated hospitalizations was less than respiratory syncytial virus, but similar to influenza and parainfluenzavirus (PIV) 3 in all age groups. The mean age of children hospitalized with HMPV was 6 months. Bronchiolitis, pneumonia and asthma were the most common diagnoses in children with HMPV. All four HMPV subgroups were detected during both years at both sites. HPMV was most prominent from March through May. CONCLUSIONS: HMPV was detected in 3.8% of children hospitalized with ARI or fever, with a population incidence similar to that of influenza and PIV3."
"Seroprevalence and immunity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents in schools in Switzerland: design for a longitudinal, school-based prospective cohort study","Introduction Seroprevalence and transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children and adolescents, especially in school setting, are not clear. Resulting uncertainty is reflected in very different decisions on school closures and reopenings across countries. The aim of this longitudinal cohort study is to assess the extent and patterns of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school-attending children repeatedly. It will examine risk factors for infection, relationship between seropositivity and symptoms, and temporal persistence of antibodies. Additionally, it will include testing of school personnel and parents. Methods and analysis The study (Ciao Corona) will enroll a regionally representative, random sample of schools in the canton of Zurich, where 18% of the Swiss population live. Children aged 5 to 16 years, attending classes in primary and secondary schools are invited. Venous blood and saliva samples are collected for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing after the first wave of infections (June/July 2020), in fall (October/November 2020), and after winter (March/April 2021). Venous blood is also collected for serological testing of parents and school personnel. Bi-monthly questionnaires to children, parents and school personnel cover SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and tests, health, preventive behavior, lifestyle and quality of life information. Total seroprevalence and cumulative incidence will be calculated. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models will account for sensitivity and specificity of the serological test in the analyses and for the complex sampling structure, i.e., clustering within classes and schools. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (2020-01336). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be made available to study participants and participating schools, the Federal Office of Public Health, and the Educational Department of the canton of Zurich. Trial registration number NCT04448717."
Advantages of Kahoot! Game-based Formative Assessments along with Methods of Its Use and Application during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Various Live Learning Sessions,"BACKGROUND: Technology has played important roles in education, thus the application of online Kahoot! Game-based technology as a learning tool particularly in formative assessments might improve learning and achieve promising education. It can be applied live, either face to face or virtual in distance learning as during the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in total shift toward online learning. METHODOLOGY: Kahoot! Game-based histology and cell biology lab formative assessments were prepared, equipped with light and electron microscopic photos, and applied for 2(nd) year undergraduate medical students. Students' engagement was evaluated by calculating number of engaged students in Kahoot! versus number of attended students in each lab. Students' satisfaction was evaluated according to students' feedback collected on Kahoot! platform and by an online questionnaire applied on Google Forms which included 5 items that were measured on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating strongly disagree and 5 indicating strongly agree, with overall satisfaction ranging between 5 (least satisfaction) and 25 (maximum satisfaction). YouTube videos were done to demonstrate and spread the idea of using Kahoot! platform in education particularly in the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Kahoot! was successfully applied in Histology and Cell Biology lab sessions. Students' engagement for Kahoot! game-based formative assessments were 100% in most lab sessions. The mean overall students' fun assessment score for Kahoot! was 4.65 out of 5. Most students recommended the use of Kahoot! game-based formative assessments. The mean overall Kahoot! questionnaire satisfaction score was 24.25 (ranging between agree and strongly agree). YouTube videos were successfully published. CONCLUSION: Kahoot! produces marked students' engagement and satisfaction in formative assessments enabling it to be applied live for any learning session either face to face or virtual for distance learning."

The Ocean 100: Transnational corporations in the ocean economy,"The ocean economy is growing as commercial use of the ocean accelerates, while progress toward achieving international goals for ocean conservation and sustainability is lagging. In this context, the private sector is increasingly recognized as having the capacity to hamper efforts to achieve aspirations of sustainable ocean-based development or alternatively to bend current trajectories of ocean use by taking on the mantle of corporate biosphere stewardship. Here, we identify levels of industry concentration to assess where this capacity rests. We show that the 10 largest companies in eight core ocean economy industries generate, on average, 45% of each industry’s total revenues. Aggregating across all eight industries, the 100 largest corporations (the “Ocean 100”) account for 60% of total revenues. This level of concentration in the ocean economy presents both risks and opportunities for ensuring sustainability and equity of global ocean use."
Single-Cell Immunogenomic Approach Identified SARS-CoV-2 Protective Immune Signatures in Asymptomatic Direct Contacts of COVID-19 Cases,"The response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is largely impacted by the level of virus exposure and status of the host immunity. The nature of protection shown by direct asymptomatic contacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients is quite intriguing. In this study, we have characterized the antibody titer, SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization, cytokine levels, single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR), and B-cell receptor (BCR) profiling in asymptomatic direct contacts, infected cases, and controls. We observed significant increase in antibodies with neutralizing amplitude in asymptomatic contacts along with cytokines such as Eotaxin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 7 (IL-7), migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α). Upon single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing, we explored the dynamics of the adaptive immune response in few representative asymptomatic close contacts and COVID-19-infected patients. We reported direct asymptomatic contacts to have decreased CD4(+) naive T cells with concomitant increase in CD4(+) memory and CD8(+) Temra cells along with expanded clonotypes compared to infected patients. Noticeable proportions of class switched memory B cells were also observed in them. Overall, these findings gave an insight into the nature of protection in asymptomatic contacts."

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections in two large academic health systems in Wisconsin,SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections may play a critical role in disease transmission. We aim to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at two hospital systems in two counties in Wisconsin. The SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 1% or lower at both systems despite the higher incidence of COVID-19 in Milwaukee county
The Associations of Built Environment with Older People Recreational Walking and Physical Activity in a Chinese Small-Scale City of Yiwu,"Physical activity would bring in plenty of health benefits, especially recreational physical activity (RPA). Previous studies have suggested that built environment would affect older people’s recreational walking (RW) and RPA, but how the effects exist in a small-scale Chinese city remains unclear. Two hundred and fifty-two older participants were recruited in the city of Yiwu using cross-sectional survey of random samples in 2019. RW and RPA level of participants and perceived scores of built environments were collected using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale, respectively. Linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association of built environment with older people’s RW and RPA. The results showed that two main factors affecting older people’s RW and RPA were residential density and aesthetics. Additionally, access to services was related to RW, and street connectivity was correlated with RPA. The associations of RW with built environment varied slightly with demographic variables included in the regression model. All the results suggested that lower residential density, better aesthetics environment, and higher street connectivity would motivate older people to engage more in RW and RPA. The better access to services encourages only RW, not RPA, in older people. These findings would be helpful for policy decision makers in the urban construction process in Yiwu. More studies are needed to enlarge the scientific evidence base about small-scale cities in China."
The Future Is Now: Incorporating Telemedicine into Glaucoma Care,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The field of teleglaucoma has expanded rapidly in recent years with several large-scale teleglaucoma screening programs in existence throughout the world. Additionally, teleglaucoma programs for use in disease management are under study. The limited access to care that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for expansion of such programs. This article reviews the literature on teleglaucoma for screening and management of glaucoma, discussing considerations for incorporating teleglaucoma into clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Teleglaucoma screening reduces the rate of false-positive referrals and can accurately screen at-risk populations with accuracy similar to in-person screening. The use of teleglaucoma for the management of glaucoma shows promise for low-risk patients with early disease. Furthermore, teleglaucoma is cost-effective and reduces travel burden for patients resulting in high patient satisfaction. SUMMARY: Teleglaucoma offers potential for improving access to glaucoma care, reducing the burden on patients and health care systems."
"Rabies elimination research: juxtaposing optimism, pragmatism and realism","More than 100 years of research has now been conducted into the prevention, control and elimination of rabies with safe and highly efficacious vaccines developed for use in human and animal populations. Domestic dogs are a major reservoir for rabies, and although considerable advances have been made towards the elimination and control of canine rabies in many parts of the world, the disease continues to kill tens of thousands of people every year in Africa and Asia. Policy efforts are now being directed towards a global target of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 and the global elimination of canine rabies. Here we demonstrate how research provides a cause for optimism as to the feasibility of these goals through strategies based around mass dog vaccination. We summarize some of the pragmatic insights generated from rabies epidemiology and dog ecology research that can improve the design of dog vaccination strategies in low- and middle-income countries and which should encourage implementation without further delay. We also highlight the need for realism in reaching the feasible, although technically more difficult and longer-term goal of global elimination of canine rabies. Finally, we discuss how research on rabies has broader relevance to the control and elimination of a suite of diseases of current concern to human and animal health, providing an exemplar of the value of a ‘One Health’ approach."
Cancer therapy and treatments during COVID-19 era,"The COVID-19 pandemic has put a serious strain on health treatments as well at the economies of many nations. Unfortunately, there is not currently available vaccine for SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19. Various types of patients have delayed treatment or even routine check-ups and we are adapting to a virtual world. In many cases, surgeries are delayed unless they are essential. This is also true with regards to cancer treatments and screening. Interestingly, some existing drugs and nutraceuticals have been screened for their effects on COVID-19. Certain FDA approved drugs, vitamin, natural products and trace minerals may be repurposed to treat or improve the prevention of COVID-19 infections and disease progression. This review article will summarize how the treatments of various cancer patients has changed during the COVID-19 era as well as discuss the promise of some existing drugs and other agents to be repurposed to treat this disease."
Structural basis for the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 virulence factor nsp1 with Pol α - Primase,"The molecular mechanisms that drive the infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus – the causative agent of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic – are under intense current scrutiny, to understand how the virus operates and to uncover ways in which the disease can be prevented or alleviated. Recent cell-based analyses of SARS-CoV-2 protein - protein interactions have mapped the human proteins targeted by the virus. The DNA polymerase α - primase complex or primosome – responsible for initiating DNA synthesis in genomic duplication – was identified as a target of nsp1 (non structural protein 1), a major virulence factor in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report the biochemical characterisation of the interaction between nsp1 and the primosome and the cryoEM structure of the primosome - nsp1 complex. Our data provide a structural basis for the reported interaction between the primosome and nsp1. They suggest that Pol α - primase plays a part in the immune response to the viral infection, and that its targeting by SARS-CoV-2 aims to interfere with such function."
Distinct SARS-CoV-2 sensing pathways in pDCs driving TLR7-antiviral vs. TLR2-immunopathological responses in COVID-19,"Understanding the molecular pathways driving the acute antiviral and inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for developing treatments for severe COVID-19. Here we show that in COVID-19 patients, circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) decline early after symptom onset and this correlated with COVID-19 disease severity. This transient depletion coincides with decreased expression of antiviral type I IFNα and the systemic inflammatory cytokines CXCL10 and IL-6. Importantly, COVID-19 disease severity correlated with decreased pDC frequency in peripheral blood. Using an in vitro stem cell-based human pDC model, we demonstrate that pDCs directly sense SARS-CoV-2 and in response produce multiple antiviral (IFNα and IFNλ1) and inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10) cytokines. This immune response is sufficient to protect epithelial cells from de novo SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted deletion of specific sensing pathways identified TLR7-MyD88 signaling as being crucial for production of the antiviral IFNs, whereas TLR2 is responsible for the inflammatory IL-6 response. Surprisingly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 engages the neuropilin-1 receptor on pDCs to mitigate the antiviral IFNs but not the IL-6 response. These results demonstrate distinct sensing pathways used by pDCs to elicit antiviral vs. immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting neuropilin-1 on pDCs may be clinically relevant for mounting TLR7-mediated antiviral protection. One Sentence Summary pDCs sense SARS-CoV-2 and elicit antiviral protection of lung epithelial cells through TLR7, while recognition of TLR2 elicits an IL-6 inflammatory response associated with immunopathology. Graphical abstract: SARS-CoV-2 sensing by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. SARS-CoV-2 is internalized by pDCs via a yet unknown endocytic mechanism. The intracellular TLR7 sensor detects viral RNA and induces a signaling cascade involving MyD88-IRAK4-TRAF6 (1) to induce CXCL10 and, via IRF7 phosphorylation and translocation, inducing type I and III Interferons (2). Once secreted, type I and III IFNs initiate autocrine and paracrine signals that induce the expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby facilitating an antiviral response that can protect the cell against infection. However, SARS-CoV-2, has the intrinsic property to facilitate CD304 signaling, potentially by interfering with IRF7 nuclear translocation, thereby inhibiting type I IFNα production and thus reducing the antiviral response generated by the pDC (4). Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) glycoprotein is sensed by the extracellular TLR2/6 heterodimer and this facilitates production of the inflammatory IL-6 cytokine (5).

"Experimental Bovine Trichophyton verrueosum Infection: Preliminary Clinical, Immunological and Histological Observations in Primarily Infected and Reinoculated Cattle","Summary The cutaneous application of different doses of viable Trichophyton verrueosum to the unabraded skin of cattle of various ages resulted in clinically recognizable ringworm infection of varying extent and duration. Confluent lesions covering the whole inoculated area were produced by 107 viable units of the fungus, whereas the minimal infective dose of 103 viable units produced limited areas of infection only. The level of nutrition within the limits imposed had no effect on the extent or severity of lesions. The fungus was found to invade the keratinized portions of skin and hair of cattle of all ages at the same rate. However, both the cutaneous inflammatory response and the resolution of lesions were most rapid in older animals. The ability to eliminate infection more rapidly was associated with a marked delayed hypersensitivity response commencing 14 days after infection. Such hypersensitivity was not detectable by this means after the resolution of lesions. T. verrueosum could not be isolated in culture from skin lesions until 21 days after inoculation and could only be isolated for half the period that lesions were present. Cattle were resistant to cutaneous reinfection with viable T. verrueosum on previously infected or fresh skin sites at 2 months and at more than one year after the resolution of primary lesions. A mild delayed hypersensitivity response developed in every site within 48 hr. of reinoculation. The intravenous inoculation of previously-infected cattle with 104 viable units of T. verrueosum resulted in an immediate-type cutaneous reaction at the original site of infection."
"Code-based Syndromic Surveillance for Influenzalike Illness by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision","With the spread of avian influenza, use of automated data streams to rapidly detect and track human influenza cases has increased. We performed correlation analyses to determine whether International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), groupings used to detect influenzalike illness (ILI) within an automated syndromic system correlate with respiratory virus laboratory test results in the same population (r = 0.71 or 0.86, depending on group). We used temporal and signal-to-noise analysis to identify 2 subsets of ICD-9 codes that most accurately represent ILI trends, compared nationwide sentinel ILI surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the automated data (r = 0.97), and found the most sensitive set of ICD-9 codes for respiratory illness surveillance. Our results demonstrate a method for selecting the best group of ICD-9 codes to assist system developers and health officials who are interpreting similar data for daily public health activities."
Between the Waves: Building Power for a Public Option.,"Given the close division of power in D.C., how might health reformers pursue their bolder aims? In particular, how might they pursue the robust public option that is a centerpiece of Joe Biden's reform proposal? This ambitious plan, which would allow all Americans to enroll in subsidized public health insurance, is not in the cards right now. However, I argue for conceiving of it as an inspiring vision that can structure immediate initiatives designed to make its achievement more feasible. First, I explain just how far-reaching the mainstream vision of the public option now is. Second, I describe a self-reinforcing path to that endpoint that involves what I call ""building power through policy""-using the openings that are likely to exist in the near term to reshape the political landscape for the long term. This path has three key steps: (1) pursuing immediate improvements in the ACA that are tangible and traceable yet do not work against the eventual creation of a public option; (2) building the necessary policy foundations for a public option, while encouraging progressive states to experiment with state public plan models; and (3) seeding and strengthening movements to press for more fundamental reform."
"Effect of intensive care unit-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) to improve psychological well-being and quality of life in COVID-19 ICU survivors: a study protocol for a multicentre, randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has resulted in a tremendous increase in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions all over the world. Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warranting ICU treatment usually have prolonged mechanical ventilation and are expected to be prone to develop psychological impairments, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression, which negatively impact quality of life. To date, no effective treatment strategy is available. In the current trial, we aim to assess the effect of an ICU-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) intervention on psychological well-being and quality of life after COVID-19 ICU treatment. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine whether COVID-19-specific ICU-VR, offered 3 months after hospital discharge, improves psychological well-being and quality of life. Secondary objectives are, firstly, to examine the intra-group changes in psychological well-being and quality of life and the inter-group differences in psychological well-being and quality of life during follow-up, up to 12 months after hospital discharge, and secondly, to examine patients’ satisfaction with and rating of ICU care and aftercare and patients’ perspectives on ICU-VR. Eighty adult patients treated for COVID-19 in the mixed-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, will be included and randomized (1:1) to either early or late ICU-VR between June 29 and December 31, 2020. Patients randomized to early ICU-VR will receive the ICU-VR intervention during an outpatient clinic visit 3 months after hospital discharge, whereas patients randomized to late ICU-VR will receive ICU-VR 6 months after hospital discharge. Primary outcomes of this study are psychological well-being, assessed using the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and quality of life, assessed using the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and RAND-36 questionnaires, up to 6 months after hospital discharge. DISCUSSION: Currently, an effective treatment for psychological sequelae after ICU treatment for specific illnesses is unavailable. Results from this study will provide insight whether virtual reality is a modality that can be used in ICU aftercare to improve psychological well-being and quality of life, or satisfaction, after ICU treatment for specific illnesses such as COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been retrospectively registered on the Netherlands Trial Register on August 14, 2020 (NL8835).

Clinical and biological insights from viral genome sequencing,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of pathogens is becoming increasingly important not only for basic research but also for clinical science and practice. In virology, WGS is important for the development of novel treatments and vaccines, and for increasing the power of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genomics. In this Opinion article, we suggest that WGS of viruses in a clinical setting will become increasingly important for patient care. We give an overview of different WGS methods that are used in virology and summarize their advantages and disadvantages. Although there are only partially addressed technical, financial and ethical issues in regard to the clinical application of viral WGS, this technique provides important insights into virus transmission, evolution and pathogenesis. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.182) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
Bacteriophages as Fecal Pollution Indicators,"Bacteriophages are promising tools for the detection of fecal pollution in different environments, and particularly for viral pathogen risk assessment. Having similar morphological and biological characteristics, bacteriophages mimic the fate and transport of enteric viruses. Enteric bacteriophages, especially phages infecting Escherichia coli (coliphages), have been proposed as alternatives or complements to fecal indicator bacteria. Here, we provide a general overview of the potential use of enteric bacteriophages as fecal and viral indicators in different environments, as well as the available methods for their detection and enumeration, and the regulations for their application."
Distance education during the COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-sectional study among medical students in North of Jordan,"INTRODUCTION: In the spot of the new emerging COVID-19 pandemic and its major impact worldwide on day-to-day activities many rules had to be changed in order to fight this pandemic. Lockdown started in Jordan and around the globe affecting several aspects of life including economy, education, entertainment, and government policies. Regarding education, the priority was to ensure the safety and progress of the educational process. Thus, new methods of teaching had to be applied using the online learning at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), Faculty of Medicine. This study was done to assess (1) Class Experience (2) Students and Lecturers' Interaction (3) Online Learning Advantages & Disadvantages (4) Students’ Preference. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted Convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data from the participants using a survey composed of 18 questions on Google Forms platform. A link was sent to the undergraduate medical students at the Jordan University of Science & Technology via their e-learning accounts (n = 3700). The form was available from May 22nd, 2020 to May 30th, 2020 for 8 days long. Data analysis was done using SPSS V 23. RESULTS: 2212 out of 3700 students responded, (55.8%) of them were in the basic years and (44.2%) of them were in the clinical years. (55.8%) of students started to take online lectures after 3 weeks. (45.7%) used the hybrid teaching method (asynchronous and synchronous), (31.4%) used live classes, and 22.8% recorded classes. Zoom was the most used platform. (48.7%) and (57%) of clinical students and basic students express their interaction as bad, while the others had good and excellent interaction. Maintaining social distance was the most advantage of online teaching, while poor technical setup and no direct contact were the most disadvantage, furthermore inability to have real clinical access was a significant problem for clinical students (p < .001). With reference to students’ preferences 75% of students were not pleased with their experience and 42% of students prefer to integrate online learning with traditional learning. CONCLUSION: Most medical students at JUST preferred the traditional face-to-face teaching method over the solo online teaching methods with recommendations to convert to a more integrated educational system. Also, a well-established infrastructure should be done in involving online teaching."
"Protocol for a prospective double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled feasibility trial of octreotide infusion during liver transplantation","INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation is a complex operation that can provide significant improvements in quality of life and survival to the recipients. However, serious complications are common and include major haemorrhage, hypotension and renal failure. Blood transfusion and the development of acute kidney injury lead to both short-term and long-term poor patient outcomes, including an increased risk of death, graft failure, length of stay and reduced quality of life. Octreotide may reduce the incidence of renal dysfunction, perioperative haemorrhage and enhance intraoperative blood pressure. However, octreotide does have risks, including resistant bradycardia, hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia and QT prolongation. Hence, a randomised controlled trial of octreotide during liver transplantation is needed to determine the cost-efficacy and safety of its use; this study represents a feasibility study prior to this trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We describe a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled feasibility study of continuous infusion of octreotide during liver transplantation surgery. We will recruit 30 adult patients at two liver transplant centres. A blinded infusion during surgery will be administered in a 2:1 ratio of octreotide:placebo. The primary outcomes will determine the feasibility of this study design. These include the recruitment ratio, correct administration of blinded study intervention, adverse event rates, patient and clinician enrolment refusal and completion of data collection. Secondary outcome measures of efficacy and safety will help shape future trials by assessing potential primary outcome measures and monitoring safety end points. No formal statistical tests are planned. This manuscript represents study protocol number 1.3, dated 2 June 2021. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received Research Ethics Committee approval. The main study outcomes will be submitted to an open-access journal. TRIAL SPONSOR: The Joint Research Office, University College London, UK. Neither the sponsor nor the funder have any role in study design, collection, management, analysis and interpretation of data, writing of the study report or the decision to submit the report for publication. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04941911) with recruitment due to start in August 2021 with anticipated completion in July 2022.

Acute myeloid leukemia with RAM immunophenotype presenting with extensive mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy: A case report and review of the literature,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with RAM immunophenotype is a rare recently described AML subtype. It is defined by blasts with strong expression of CD56 and weak to absent expression of CD45, HLA-DR....., and CD38 and characterized by significantly worse outcome [1]. Little is known about the clinical presentation and this immunophenotype is not widely recognized in clinical practice. We describe a case of AML with RAM immunophenotype in a 5-year-old male patient with a unique presentation, including extensive mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic studies included bilateral bone marrow and lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and next generation sequencing. Bone marrow biopsy revealed >90% blasts, positive for CD34, CD117, and CD56 by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Next generation sequencing revealed BCOR loss and CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion. Following induction chemotherapy, bone marrow biopsy showed residual disease and a stem cell transplant was performed. The patient relapsed three months after transplant and subsequently passed away eleven months after initial diagnosis. Limited literature is available describing this newly identified AML subset. The RAM immunophenotype has been identified as an independent prognostic factor for relapse rate and overall and disease-free survival [1]. Few case reports are available to characterize the genetic profile, typical presentation, and clinical course of patients with this unique immunophenotype."
Multiprotein Complex Production in Insect Cells by Using Polyproteins,"A powerful approach utilizing polyproteins for balancing stoichiometry of recombinant multiprotein complexes overproduced in baculovirus expression vector systems (BEVS) is described. This procedure has been implemented here in the MultiBac system but can also be directly adapted to all commonly used BEVS. The protocol details the design principles of polyprotein-expressing DNA constructs, the generation of composite baculovirus for polyprotein production, and the expression and in vivo processing of polyproteins in baculovirus infected insect cells."
"Design and performance analysis of a parabolic trough power plant under the climatological conditions of Tamanrasset, Algeria","Algeria’s energy demands are tremendously growing, and on the African continent it ranks among the countries with the highest energy consumption. To counter its growing energy demand, the country is progressively adopting renewable energy technologies, although conventional energy technologies still play a central role in its electricity production. The huge solar energy potential in Algeria can be exploited and utilized to meet the country’s growing energy demand with minimal greenhouse gas production. Given that concentrating solar power is viewed as one of the most promising alternatives in the field of solar energy utilization, this study investigates the viability of a 100 MW parabolic trough-based power plant at Tamanrasset, Algeria. The plant was simulated in the System Advisor Model software considering the actual electricity load profile of the targeted location and implementing two different condenser types: evaporative and air-cooled. By comparing the plant’s electricity production to the city’s real load, the plant was in position of supplying about 78% and 60% of the city’s electricity demand during the winter and summer seasons, respectively. The results show that implementation of such CSP plants could play an important role in meeting the energy demand as well as mitigating climate change through greenhouse emissions avoided in electricity generation process."
Plitidepsin has potent preclinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the host protein eEF1A,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins interact with the eukaryotic translation machinery, and inhibitors of translation have potent antiviral effects. We found that the drug plitidepsin (aplidin), which has limited clinical approval, possesses antiviral activity (90% inhibitory concentration = 0.88 nM) that is more potent than remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by a factor of 27.5, with limited toxicity in cell culture. Through the use of a drug-resistant mutant, we show that the antiviral activity of plitidepsin against SARS-CoV-2 is mediated through inhibition of the known target eEF1A (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A). We demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of plitidepsin treatment in two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a reduction of viral replication in the lungs by two orders of magnitude using prophylactic treatment. Our results indicate that plitidepsin is a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19."
534 Takotsubo syndrome secondary to vaccination for SARS-CoV-2,"METHODS AND RESULTS: A 79-year-old woman, with a history of subclinical hypothyroidism, obesity and smoke presented to the Emergency Room with dyspnoea and cold sweating. She had undergone her first dose of COVID-19 Moderna mRna vaccination just four days prior to her admission. She showed elevated HS troponin and elevated BNP at her laboratory exams. Her 12-lead ECG showed T wave inversion in the antero-lateral leads and prolongued QTc. Her transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe ejection fraction reduction due to hypokinesia of the mid-apical segments of the anterior and lateral walls of the heart. The patient was then admitted to the Cardiology ward in order to perform a coronary angiography which sowed no significant coronary stenosis. She was started on appropriate medication and discharged after a six day in-hospital stay. At discharge she showed partial recovery of her ejection fraction (EF 44%). A cardiac magnetic resonance was performed after discharge which showed no late gadolinium enhancement. Such finding allowed us to rule out the diagnosis of myocarditis. Moreover at her 3-month follow-up her ejection fraction had recovered completely. We concluded for the diagnosis of Takotsubo Syndrome secondary to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a case of Takotsubo syndrome after vaccination with the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19. Two other similar case reports can be found in current medical literature. Female sex, post-menopausal age and the inevitable psychological stress derived by the pandemic and the vaccination may have triggered the condition. [Image: see text]"
Development of severity and mortality prediction models for covid-19 patients at emergency department including the chest x-ray(),"OBJECTIVES: To develop prognosis prediction models for COVID-19 patients attending an emergency department (ED) based on initial chest X-ray (CXR), demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters. METHODS: All symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital ED between February 24th and April 24th 2020 were recruited. CXR features, clinical and laboratory variables and CXR abnormality indices extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) diagnostic tool were considered potential predictors on this first visit. The most serious individual outcome defined the three severity level: 0) home discharge or hospitalization ≤ 3 days, 1) hospital stay >3 days and 2) intensive care requirement or death. Severity and in-hospital mortality multivariable prediction models were developed and internally validated. The Youden index was used for the optimal threshold selection of the classification model. RESULTS: A total of 440 patients were enrolled (median 64 years; 55.9% male); 13.6% patients were discharged, 64% hospitalized, 6.6% required intensive care and 15.7% died. The severity prediction model included oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen fraction (SatO2/FiO2), age, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, extent score of lung involvement on CXR (ExtScoreCXR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer level and platelets count, with AUC-ROC = 0.94 and AUC-PRC = 0.88. The mortality prediction model included age, SatO2/FiO2, CRP, LDH, CXR extent score, lymphocyte count and D-dimer level, with AUC-ROC = 0.97 and AUC-PRC = 0.78. The addition of CXR CNN-based indices did not improve significantly the predictive metrics. CONCLUSION: The developed and internally validated severity and mortality prediction models could be useful as triage tools in ED for patients with COVID-19 or other virus infections with similar behaviour."
"Case-control study of patient characteristics, knowledge of the COVID-19 disease, risk behaviour and mental state in patients visiting an emergency room with COVID-19 symptoms in the Netherlands","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is a serious respiratory virus pandemic. Patient characteristics, knowledge of the COVID-19 disease, risk behaviour and mental state will differ between individuals. The primary aim of this study was to investigate these variables in patients visiting an emergency department in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the “COVID-19 suspected” (positive and negative tested group) with the “COVID-19 not suspected” (control group) and to compare in the “COVID-19 suspected” group, the positive and negative tested patients. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients, visiting the emergency room at the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were asked to fill out questionnaires on the abovementioned items on an iPad. The patients were either “COVID-19 suspected” (positive and negative tested group) or “COVID-19 not suspected” (control group). RESULTS: This study included a total of 159 patients, 33 (21%) tested positive, 85 (53%) negative and 41 (26%) were COVID-19 not suspected (control group). All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Working as a health care professional was correlated to a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (p- value 0.04). COVID-19 suspected patients had a significantly higher level of anxiety compared to COVID-19 not suspected patients (p-value < 0.001). The higher the anxiety, the more seriously hygiene measures were followed. The anxiety scores of the patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly higher than without comorbidities. CONCLUSION: This is one of the first (large) study that investigates and compares patient characteristics, knowledge, behaviour, illness perception, and mental state with respect to COVID-19 of patients visiting the emergency room, subdivided as being suspected of having COVID-19 (positive or negative tested) and a control group not suspected of having COVID-19. All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. COVID-19 suspected patients and patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly more anxious. However, there is no mass hysteria regarding COVID-19. The higher the degree of fear, the more carefully hygiene measures were observed. Knowledge about the coping of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic is very important, certainly also in the perspective of a possible second outbreak of COVID-19."
Comparative Study of Cytokine Storm Treatment in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia Using Immunomodulators,"(1) Background: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially moderate and severe forms, a cytokine storm may occur, characterized by the worsening of symptoms and the alteration of biological parameters on days 8–12 of the disease. The therapeutic options for cytokine storms are still controversial, requiring further clarification; (2) Methods: Our study included 344 patients with moderate and severe pneumonia admitted to the internal medicine department who developed a cytokine storm (diagnosed by clinical and biochemical criteria). In group A, 149 patients were treated with Remdesivir and Tocilizumab (together with other drugs, including corticosteroids, antibiotics and anticoagulants), and in group B, 195 patients received Remdesivir and Anakinra. Patients were monitored clinically and by laboratory tests, with the main biochemical parameters being CRP (C-reactive protein), LDH (lactic dehydrogenase) and ferritin; (3) Results: Patients were followed up from a clinical point of view and also by the measurement of CRP, LDH and ferritin at the beginning of therapy, on days three to four and on the tenth day. In both groups, we registered a clinical improvement and a decrease in the parameters of the cytokine storm. In group A, with the IL-6 antagonist Tocilizumab, the beneficial effect occurred faster; in group B, with the IL-1 antagonist Anakinra, the beneficial effect was slower. (4) Conclusions: The use of the immunomodulators, Tocilizumab and Anakinra, in the cytokine storm showed favorable effects, both clinical and biochemical."

"Transboundary sources dominated PM(2.5) in Thimphu, Bhutan","This study estimates the potential source regions contributing to PM(2.5) in the capital city of Thimphu, Bhutan, during the years 2018–2020 using the ground-based data, followed by the HYSPLIT back trajectory analysis. The average PM(2.5) concentration in the entire study period was 32.47 µg/m(3) which is three times of the World Health Organization recommended limit of 10 µg/m(3). Less than half of the days in pre-monsoon (43.47%) and post-monsoon (46.41%), and no days in winter were within the 24-h average WHO guideline of 25 μg/m(3). During the COVID-19 lockdown imposed from August 11 to September 21 in Bhutan, only a marginal reduction of 4% in the PM(2.5) concentrations was observed, indicating that nonlocal emissions dominate the PM(2.5) concentrations in Thimphu, Bhutan. Most back trajectories in the analysis period were allocated to south or south-west sector. India was the major contributor (~ 44%), followed by Bangladesh (~ 19%), Bhutan itself (~ 19%) and China (~ 16%). This study confirms that there are significant contributions from transboundary sources to PM(2.5) concentrations in Thimphu, Bhutan, and the elevated PM(2.5) concentrations need to be tackled with appropriate action plans and interventions."
Predictors of mortality for hospitalized young adults aged less than 60 years old with severe COVID-19: a retrospective study.,"Background To analyze the clinical characteristics and predictors for mortality of adult younger than 60 years old with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We retrospectively retrieved data for 152 severe inpatients with COVID-19 including 60 young patients in the Eastern Campus of Wuhan University affiliated Renmin Hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 31, 2020 to February 20, 2020. We recorded and analyzed patients' demographic, clinical, laboratory, and chest CT findings, treatment and outcomes data. Results Of those 60 severe young patients, 15 (25%) were died. Male was more predominant in deceased young patients (12, 80%) than that in recovered young patients (22, 49%). Hypertension was more common among deceased young patients (8, 53%) than that in recovered young patients (7, 16%). Compared with the recovered young patients, more deceased young patients presented with sputum (11, 73%), dyspnea (12, 80%) and fatigue (13, 87%). Only sputum, PSI and neutrophil counts were remained as independent predictors of death in a multivariate logistic regression model. Among ARDS patients, the recovered were administrated with corticosteroid earlier and anticoagulation. The addition of neutrophil counts >6.3×109/L to the SMART-COP score resulted in improved area under the curves. Conclusions Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection in young deceased patients appears to cause exuberant inflammatory responses, leading to compromised oxygen exchange, coagulation and multi-organ dysfunction. In addition, young patients with ARDS could benefit from adjuvant early corticosteroid and anticoagulation therapy. The expanded SMART-COP could predict the fatal outcomes with optimal efficiency."
"Markers Of Coagulation And Hemostatic Activation Identify COVID-19 Patients At High Risk For Thrombotic Events, ICU Admission and Intubation","BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a coagulopathy giving rise to venous and arterial thrombotic events. The objective of our study was to determine whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA) on admission could identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events and other complications. MethodsCOVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3, 2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent standardized admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and fibrin monomer) with abnormal MOCHA defined as [â¥] 2 markers above the reference. Prespecified thrombotic endpoints included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and access line thrombosis; other complications included ICU admission, intubation and mortality. We excluded patients on anticoagulation therapy prior to admission and those who were pregnant. ResultsOf 276 patients (mean age 59 {+/-} 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American race) who met study criteria, 45 (16%) had a thrombotic event. Each coagulation marker on admission was independently associated with a vascular endpoint (p<0.05). Admission MOCHA with [â¥] 2 abnormalities (n=203, 74%) was associated with in-hospital vascular endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8), as were admission D-dimer [â¥] 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6), and admission D-dimer [â¥] 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only admission MOCHA with [â¥] 2 abnormalities was associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4), while admission D-dimer [â¥]2000 ng/mL and admission D-dimer [â¥] 3000 ng/mL were not associated. MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had a sensitivity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93% for a vascular endpoint. ConclusionsAdmission MOCHA with [â¥] 2 abnormalities identified COVID-19 patients at increased risk of ICU admission and intubation during hospitalization more effectively than isolated admission D-dimer measurement. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities identified a subgroup of patients at low risk for vascular events. Our results suggest that an admission MOCHA profile can be useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients."
In silico investigation of the new UK (B.1.1.7) and South African (501Y.V2) SARS-CoV-2 variants with a focus at the ACE2-Spike RBD interface,"SARS-CoV-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to invade cells. It has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission capabilities, eventually due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor and several in silico methods to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements (Spike K417N, E484K, N501Y) with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement in this region of the interface (present in both UK and South African strains) should be favorable for the interaction with ACE2 while the K417N and E484K substitutions (South African) would seem unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African strain could counterbalance the predicted less favorable (regarding binding) K417N and E484K Spike replacements. Our finding suggests that, if indeed the South African strain has a high transmission level, this could be due to the N501Y replacement and/or to substitutions in regions outside the direct Spike-ACE2 interface. Hihglights Transmission of the UK and possibly South African SARS-CoV-2 strains appears substantially increased compared to other variants This could be due, in part, to increased affinity between the variant Spike proteins and ACE2 We investigated in silico the 3D structure of the Spike-ACE2 complex with a focus on Spike K417N, E484K and N501Y The N501Y substitution is predicted to increase the affinity toward ACE2 (UK strain) with subsequent enhanced transmissibility and possibly pathogenicity Additional substitutions at positions 417 and 484 (South African strain) may pertub the interaction with ACE2 raising questions about transmissibility and pathogenicity"
Performance behaviour of agro-waste based gypsum hollow blocks for partition walls,"Crop residue management is a massive problem in the agriculture sector. Agricultural waste in the form of stubble which is usually burnt in the farm fields, causes severe air pollution and poses a threat to the environment. The present study investigates the addition of agro-waste (rice straw) in gypsum hollow-core blocks for partition walls. Various compositions of agro-waste-based gypsum samples have been studied for compressive strength, thermal, sound absorption, sound transmission loss, and fire-resistant properties. The addition of rice straw in gypsum reduces the density and compressive strength of the test sample, thus making it lightweight for non-load bearing wall application. The thermal conductivity of the rice straw added gypsum samples show a decrease in thermal conductivity from 0.2 to 0.11 W/m K. Acoustic properties viz., noise reduction coefficient (NRC) increases from 25 to 45% with increase in rice straw addition and a decreasing trend in sound transmission class (STC) from 37 to 28 dB. The fire-resistant properties viz., surface spread of flame, and fire propagation index test have shown good fire-resistant properties. The agro-waste-based hollow gypsum blocks may be used as a promising material for drywall partitions owing to its thermal insulation, low density, good acoustic and fire-resistant properties."
The impact of mitigation measures on perinatal outcomes during the first nine months of the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review with meta-analysis,"Worldwide reports have produced conflicting data on perinatal outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review and meta-analysis addressed the effect of mitigation measures against COVID-19 on preterm birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, and NICU admission during the first nine months of the pandemic. A search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase and SCOPUS for manuscripts published up until 24th May 2021. Studies that reported perinatal outcomes (preterm birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, NICU admission) during the COVID-19 pandemic with a pre-pandemic control period were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using ROBINS-I tool. RevMan5 was used to perform meta-analysis with random-effects models. A score of the stringency of mitigation measures was calculated from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Thirty-eight studies of moderate to serious risk of bias were included, with varied methodology, analysis and regional mitigation measures, using stringency index scores. There was no overall effect on preterm birth at less than 37 weeks (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92–1.00). However, there was a reduction in preterm birth at less than 37 weeks (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81–0.98) and 34 weeks (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37–0.83) for iatrogenic births and in singleton pregnancies. There was also a significant reduction in preterm births at less than 34 weeks in studies with above median stringency index scores (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58–0.88). There was no effect on risk of stillbirth (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90–1.19) or birth weight. NICU admission rates were significantly reduced in studies with above median stringency index scores (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78–0.97). The reduction in preterm births in regions with high mitigation measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely driven by a reduction in iatrogenic births. Variability in study design and cohort characteristics need to be considered for future studies to allow further investigation of population level health measures of perinatal outcomes."
"Characteristics of the First 284 Patients Infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 Subvariant at a Single Center in the Apulia Region of Italy, January–March 2022","Since its initial detection, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineage BA.2 has been spreading rapidly worldwide. The aims of this study were to describe the first 284 patients infected with the Omicron BA.2 variant of concern (VOC) in the Apulia region of southern Italy and to assess the differences in the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 and BA.2 variants. The demographic characteristics of patients, as well as information about symptoms, vaccinations and hospitalizations for COVID-19, were collected. A subset of samples from patients infected with the BA.2 variant was subjected to whole-genome sequencing. The characteristics of the first 284 patients infected with Omicron BA.2 and the first 175 patients infected with Omicron BA.1 were compared. The proportion of patients infected with the BA.2 variant rapidly increased, from 0.5% during the third week of 2022 to 29.6% during the tenth week of 2022. Ten isolates (out of 34 BA.2 isolates) contain the substitutional mutation, H78K in ORF3a, and four isolates include two mutations, A2909V in ORF1a and L140F in ORDF3a. Compared with patients infected with BA.1, those infected with BA.2 were more likely to be symptomatic and booster-vaccinated, and showed a shorter time from the last dose of vaccine to infection. The high transmissibility and immune-evasive properties of Omicron BA.2, which will become the leading SARS-CoV-2 VOC, suggest that short-term public health measures should not be discontinued in Italy."

Current and Promising Antivirals Against Chikungunya Virus,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative agent of chikungunya fever (CHIKF) and is categorized as a(n) (re)emerging arbovirus. CHIKV has repeatedly been responsible for outbreaks that caused serious economic and public health problems in the affected countries. To date, no vaccine or specific antiviral therapies are available. This review gives a summary on current antivirals that have been investigated as potential therapeutics against CHIKF. The mode of action as well as possible compound targets (viral and host targets) are being addressed. This review hopes to provide critical information on the in vitro efficacies of various compounds and might help researchers in their considerations for future experiments."
"Government Actions and Their Relation to Resilience in Healthcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic in New South Wales, Australia and Ontario, Canada.","BACKGROUND Resilience, a system's ability to maintain a desired level of performance when circumstances disturb its functioning, is an increasingly important concept in healthcare. However, empirical investigations of resilience in healthcare (RiH) remain uncommon, particularly those that examine how government actions contribute to the capacity for resilient performance in the healthcare setting. We sought to investigate how governmental actions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic related to the concept of resilience, how these actions contributed to the potential for resilient performance in healthcare, and what opportunities exist for governments to foster resilience within healthcare systems. METHODS We conducted case studies of government actions pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales, Australia and Ontario, Canada. Using media releases issued by each government between December 2019 and August 2020, we performed qualitative content analysis to identify themes relevant to the resilience potentials (anticipate, monitor, respond, learn) and RiH. RESULTS Direct references to the term 'resilience' appeared in the media releases of both governments. However, these references focused on the reactive aspects of resilience. While actions that constitute the resilience potentials were evident, the media releases also revealed opportunities to enhance learning (eg, a need to capitalize on opportunities for double-loop learning and identify strategies appropriate for complex systems) and anticipating (eg, incorporating the concept of hedging into frameworks of RiH). CONCLUSION Though fostering RiH through government action remains a challenge, this study suggests opportunities to realize this goal. Articulating a proactive vision of resilience and recognizing the complex nature of current systems could enhance governments' ability to coordinate resilient performance in healthcare. Reflection on how anticipation relates to resilience appears necessary at both the practical and conceptual levels to further develop the capacity for RiH."

"The Clinical Diagnostic Values of SAA, PCT, CRP, and IL-6 in Children with Bacterial, Viral, or Co-Infections","BACKGROUND: Bacterial, viral, and bacterial and viral co-infections generally lead to inflammatory-related diseases. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical diagnostic values of serum amyloid A (SAA), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin (IL)-6 in children with bacterial, viral, or co-infections. METHODS: A total of 181 children with infection symptoms (bacterial infection (Bac group), n = 46; viral infection (Vir group), n = 7; co-infections (Bac + Vir group), n = 128) were enrolled in our hospital from December 2019 to April 2020. Meanwhile, 42 healthy children without any infections were used as the controls. Venous blood samples were collected and the levels of serum SAA, PCT, CRP, and IL-6 were determined by immunoluminometric assay under an IMMAGE(®) analyzer. The diagnostic values of these biomarkers were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The results indicated that IL-6 level was increased in three infection groups compared to the controls. Both SAA and CRP were significantly elevated in Vir and Bac + Vir groups. High level of PCT was observed in Bac and Bac + Vir goups. In addition, PCT (0.9281, 95% CI = 0.8645–0.9916) alone is an effective method for identifying bacterial infections. SAA in combination with CRP may distinguish co-infection from bacterial infection. Simultaneous positive of SAA, PCT, IL-6, and CRP can discriminate co-infection from the healthy controls. CONCLUSION: In a word, the levels of serum SAA, PCT, CRP, and IL-6 are increased to varying degrees in different infection situations. Our findings may provide early diagnosis for patients with different infections."
112 Incidence of postpartum depression (PPD) in SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers who underwent maternal-neonatal separation,"Objective: To evaluate the incidence of postpartum depression in mothers who endured maternal-neonatal separation at delivery and in the postpartum period due to their SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR status. Study Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women who delivered during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 18th to May 12th 2020, when maternal-neonatal separation was recommended for SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers by the American Academy of Pediatrics. We excluded women who were less than 18 years of age at the time of delivery and those who experienced an IUFD or neonatal death. We investigated the difference in postpartum depression rates between SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers. SARS-CoV-2 status was determined using a nasopharyngeal PCR swab upon admission to labor and delivery. We conducted analyses using Fischer Exact Tests, where a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): The incidence of postpartum depression was 2.4% in SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers versus 10.3% in SARS-COV-2 positive mothers with a p-value of 0.02. The relative risk of developing PPD in SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers was 3.73 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.03-13.4 with a p-value of 0.04. Conclusion(s): There was increased incidence and relative risk of postpartum depression in patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients and providers should be made aware of this possible association. One possible contributing factor to the increased incidence of postpartum depression may have been maternal-neonatal separation. Current CDC evidence demonstrates low risk of neonatal acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic positive mothers. The results of this study suggest another reason to follow the updated American Academy of Pediatrics SARS-CoV-2 recommendation, that asymptomatic mothers positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be allowed to room in with their neonate and not endure maternal-neonatal separation.

A scoping review of hard systems and tools that restrict money and cash for gambling,"BACKGROUND: Gamblers engage in a range of “soft” financial options to limit access to money or cash for gambling (e.g., family looks after cash). Such barriers are easily overturned, resulting in a demand for financial systems and tools that offer “hard” restrictions on access to money and cash in a gambling context. The aim of this scoping review was to determine the attitudes and preferences of gamblers and their families on systems or tools to restrict access to money and cash, as well as the effectiveness of systems and tools that can be used to accomplish that goal. METHODS: A systematic search of articles related to financial restrictions and gambling was conducted. Eligibility criteria included samples of gamblers or affected others and interventions targeted at money or cash restrictions in a gambling context. Soft financial barriers such as family involvement were excluded, as were limit-setting systems which focused on gambling expenditure in gambling venues. RESULTS: Nine studies met the eligibility criteria, with three focused on financial systems (e.g., ban on credit betting) and six focused on removal of cash machines from gambling venues. The included literature was generally of low quality, with just two pre-post studies and seven cross-sectional or qualitative ones. CONCLUSIONS: The included studies provided strong support for financial mechanisms to support gamblers and their families. Future studies need to involve multiple stakeholders to provide this type of support as well as to evaluate the holistic impact that such hard barriers can have on gambling and gambling-related harms."
Strong Correlation between the Case Fatality Rate of COVID-19 and the rs6598045 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) of the Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 (IFITM3) Gene at the Population-Level,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a fatal pandemic disease that is caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 13 December, 2020, over 70,000,000 cases and 1,500,000 deaths have been reported over a period of several months; however, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 has not been elucidated. To identify the novel risk genetic biomarker for COVID-19, we evaluated the correlation between the case fatality rate of COVID-19 and the genetic polymorphisms of several potential COVID-19-related genes, including interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), interleukin 6 (IL6), leucine zipper transcription factor-like protein 1 (LZTFL1), and the ABO genes, in various ethnic groups. We obtained the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths from the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dashboard and calculated the case fatality rate of each ethnic group. In addition, we obtained the allele distribution of the polymorphisms of the IFITM3, ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL6, LZTFL1, and ABO genes from the 1000 Genomes Project and performed Log-linear regression analysis using SAS version 9.4. We found different COVID-19 case fatality rates in each ethnic group. Notably, we identified a strong correlation between the case fatality rate of COVID-19 and the allele frequency of the rs6598045 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the IFITM3 gene. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe a strong correlation between the COVID-19 case fatality rate and the rs6598045 SNP of the IFITM3 gene at the population-level."

Framework for identification and measurement of spillover effects in policy implementation: intended non-intended targeted non-targeted spillovers (INTENTS),"BACKGROUND: There is increasing awareness among researchers and policymakers of the potential for healthcare interventions to have consequences beyond those initially intended. These unintended consequences or “spillover effects” result from the complex features of healthcare organisation and delivery and can either increase or decrease overall effectiveness. Their potential influence has important consequences for the design and evaluation of implementation strategies and for decision-making. However, consideration of spillovers remains partial and unsystematic. We develop a comprehensive framework for the identification and measurement of spillover effects resulting from changes to the way in which healthcare services are organised and delivered. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review to map the existing literature on spillover effects in health and healthcare interventions and used the findings of this review to develop a comprehensive framework to identify and measure spillover effects. RESULTS: The scoping review identified a wide range of different spillover effects, either experienced by agents not intentionally targeted by an intervention or representing unintended effects for targeted agents. Our scoping review revealed that spillover effects tend to be discussed in papers only when they are found to be statistically significant or might account for unexpected findings, rather than as a pre-specified feature of evaluation studies. This hinders the ability to assess all potential implications of a given policy or intervention. We propose a taxonomy of spillover effects, classified based on the outcome and the unit experiencing the effect: within-unit, between-unit, and diagonal spillover effects. We then present the INTENTS framework: Intended Non-intended TargEted Non-Targeted Spillovers. The INTENTS framework considers the units and outcomes which may be affected by an intervention and the mechanisms by which spillover effects are generated. CONCLUSIONS: The INTENTS framework provides a structured guide for researchers and policymakers when considering the potential effects that implementation strategies may generate, and the steps to take when designing and evaluating such interventions. Application of the INTENTS framework will enable spillover effects to be addressed appropriately in future evaluations and decision-making, ensuring that the full range of costs and benefits of interventions are correctly identified.

Flexible polymeric patch based nanotherapeutics against non-cancer therapy,"Flexible polymeric patches find widespread applications in biomedicine because of their biological and tunable features including excellent patient compliance, superior biocompatibility and biodegradation, as well as high loading capability and permeability of drug. Such polymeric patches are classified into microneedles (MNs), hydrogel, microcapsule, microsphere and fiber depending on the formed morphology. The combination of nanomaterials with polymeric patches allows for improved advantages of increased curative efficacy and lowered systemic toxicity, promoting on-demand and regulated drug administration, thus providing the great potential to their clinic translation. In this review, the category of flexible polymeric patches that are utilized to integrate with nanomaterials is briefly presented and their advantages in bioapplications are further discussed. The applications of nanomaterials embedded polymeric patches in non-cancerous diseases were also systematically reviewed, including diabetes therapy, wound healing, dermatological disease therapy, bone regeneration, cardiac repair, hair repair, obesity therapy and some immune disease therapy. Alternatively, the limitations, latest challenges and future perspectives of such biomedical therapeutic devices are addressed."
GMP-Compliant Production of Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells in the NANT 001 Closed Automated Bioreactor,"In recent years mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have received a great deal of interest for the treatment of major diseases, but clinical translation and market authorization have been slow. This has been due in part to a lack of standardization in cell manufacturing protocols, as well as a lack of biologically meaningful cell characterization tools and release assays. Cell production strategies to date have involved complex manual processing in an open environment which is costly, inefficient and poses risks of contamination. The NANT 001 bioreactor has been developed for the automated production of small to medium cell batches for autologous use. This is a closed, benchtop system which automatically performs several processes including cell seeding, media change, real-time monitoring of temperature, pH, cell confluence and cell detachment. Here we describe a validation of the bioreactor in an environment compliant with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) to confirm its utility in replacing standardized manual processing. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was isolated from lipoaspirate material obtained from healthy donors. SVF cells were seeded in the bioreactor. Cell processing was performed automatically and cell harvesting was triggered by computerized analysis of images captured by a travelling microscope positioned beneath the cell culture flask. For comparison, the same protocol was performed in parallel using manual methods. Critical quality attributes (CQA) assessed for cells from each process included cell yield, viability, surface immunophenotype, differentiation propensity, microbial sterility and endotoxin contamination. Cell yields from the bioreactor cultures were comparable in the manual and automated cultures and viability was >90% for both. Expression of surface markers were consistent with standards for adipose-derived stromal cell (ASC) phenotype. ASCs expanded in both automated and manual processes were capable of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Supernatants from all cultures tested negative for microbial and endotoxin contamination. Analysis of labor commitment indicated considerable economic advantage in the automated system in terms of operator, quality control, product release and management personnel. These data demonstrate that the NANT 001 bioreactor represents an effective option for small to medium scale, automated, closed expansion of ASCs from SVF and produces cell products with CQA equivalent to manual processes."
Public pension shortfalls and state economic growth: a preliminary examination,"Public pension funding problems may contribute to a state's poor economic performance. This paper examines that proposition, using state-level data on public pensions developed by the Pew Trust, and jointly by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. There is little evidence that measures of the level of unfunded pension plan liabilities lead directly to a state's soft economic performance, though growth in unfunded liabilities appear to be associated with lower growth. While these results suggest that reductions in the growth of a state's pension debt may be beneficial, they arguably do not imply that dramatic action to reduce liabilities is necessarily called for. In that regard, the implications are comparable to those of Lenney et al. (2019), that suggest that reasonable goals for some presumed highly troubled systems are stabilization of the ratio of their unfunded liabilities to their state's nominal GDP, rather than outright elimination of the debt."

Insight into the Role of Angiopoietins in Ageing-Associated Diseases,"Angiopoietin (Ang) and its receptor, TIE signaling, contribute to the development and maturation of embryonic vasculature as well as vascular remodeling and permeability in adult tissues. Targeting both this signaling pathway and the major pathway with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is expected to permit clinical applications, especially in antiangiogenic therapies against tumors. Several drugs targeting the Ang-TIE signaling pathway in cancer patients are under clinical development. Similar to how cancer increases with age, unsuitable angiogenesis or endothelial dysfunction is often seen in other ageing-associated diseases (AADs) such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the Ang-TIE pathway is a possible molecular target for AAD therapy. In this review, we focus on the potential role of the Ang-TIE signaling pathway in AADs, especially non-cancer-related AADs. We also suggest translational insights and future clinical applications of this pathway in those AADs."
Strengthening field-based training in low and middle-income countries to build public health capacity: Lessons from Australia's Master of Applied Epidemiology program,"BACKGROUND: The International Health Regulations (2005) and the emergence and global spread of infectious diseases have triggered a re-assessment of how rich countries should support capacity development for communicable disease control in low and medium income countries (LMIC). In LMIC, three types of public health training have been tried: the university-based model; streamed training for specialised workers; and field-based programs. The first has low rates of production and teaching may not always be based on the needs and priorities of the host country. The second model is efficient, but does not accord the workers sufficient status to enable them to impact on policy. The third has the most potential as a capacity development measure for LMIC, but in practice faces challenges which may limit its ability to promote capacity development. DISCUSSION: We describe Australia's first Master of Applied Epidemiology (MAE) model (established in 1991), which uses field-based training to strengthen the control of communicable diseases. A central attribute of this model is the way it partners and complements health department initiatives to enhance workforce skills, health system performance and the evidence-base for policies, programs and practice. SUMMARY: The MAE experience throws light on ways Australia could collaborate in regional capacity development initiatives. Key needs are a shared vision for a regional approach to integrate training with initiatives that strengthen service and research, and the pooling of human, financial and technical resources. We focus on communicable diseases, but our findings and recommendations are generalisable to other areas of public health."
Cardiac Troponins: Contemporary Biological Data and New Methods of Determination,"Laboratory diagnosis plays one of the key roles in the diagnosis of many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The methods underlying the in vitro study of many CVD biomarkers, including cardiac troponins (cTnI and cTnT), are imperfect and are continually being improved to enhance their analytical performance, with sensitivity and specificity being the most important. Recently developed improved cTnI and cTnT detection methods, referred to as highly sensitive methods (hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT), have changed many of our ideas about the biology of cardiac troponins and opened up a number of additional diagnostic capabilities for practical healthcare. This article systematizes some relevant data on the biology of cardiac troponins as well as on methods for determining cTnI and cTnT with an analysis of the diagnostic value of their analytical characteristics (limit of blank, limit of detection, 99th percentile, coefficient of variation, and others). Data on extracardiac expression of cTnI and cTnT, mechanisms of formation and potential clinical significance of gender, age, and circadian characteristics of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT content in serum are discussed. Considerable attention is paid to the discussion of new diagnostic capabilities of hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT, including consideration of promising possibilities for their study in biological fluids that can be obtained by non-invasive methods. Also, some possibilities of using hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT as prognostic laboratory biomarkers in healthy people (for example, to assess the risk of developing CVD) and in patients suffering from a number of pathological conditions that cause damage to cardiomyocytes are examined, and the potential mechanisms underlying the increase in hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT are discussed."
Kawasaki disease in siblings in close temporal proximity to each other—what are the implications?,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is the commonest medium vessel vasculitis in children. The etiology of KD remains an enigma despite extensive research. Infections are considered to be one of the triggers for KD, especially in genetically susceptible hosts. KD occurring within a short time interval among siblings is an important clinical observation supporting this hypothesis. In addition, siblings of children with KD are at a higher risk of developing the disease as compared with other children. Screening for KD in febrile siblings, therefore, seems prudent. This would help initiate timely therapy and prevent complications. We briefly review 16 English language reports of KD in siblings diagnosed within 1 month of each other to highlight its etiological and therapeutic implications."

Importance of Increased Arterial Resistance in Risk Prediction in Patients with Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Degenerative Aortic Stenosis,"Background: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of heart failure (HF) and major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE). Objective: To evaluate impact of vascular resistance on HF and MACCE incidence in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors (CRF) and degenerative aortic valve stenosis (DAS). Methods: From January 2016 to December 2018, in 404 patients with cardiovascular disease, including 267 patients with moderate-to-severe DAS and 137 patients with CRF, mean values of resistive index (RI) and pulsatile index (PI) were obtained from carotid and vertebral arteries. Patients were followed-up for 2.5 years, for primary outcome of HF and MACCE episodes. Results: RI and PI values in patients with DAS compared to CRF were significantly higher, with optimal cut-offs discriminating arterial resistance of ≥0.7 for RI (sensitivity: 80.5%, specificity: 78.8%) and ≥1.3 for PI (sensitivity: 81.3%, specificity: 79.6%). Age, female gender, diabetes, and DAS were all independently associated with increased resistance. During the follow-up period, 68 (16.8%) episodes of HF-MACCE occurred. High RI (odds ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.13–1.37) and PI (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.10–1.34) were associated with risk of HF-MACCE. Conclusions: An accurate assessment of vascular resistance may be used for HF-MACCE risk stratification in patients with DAS."

Acute arterial thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 in the New York City area,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predisposes to arterial and venous thromboembolic complications. We describe the clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of acute arterial ischemia and concomitant infection at the epicenter of cases in the United States. METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between March 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020 with an acute arterial thromboembolic event were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, anatomical location of the thromboembolism, treatments, and outcomes. RESULTS: Over the 11-week period, Northwell Health System cared for 12,630 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 49 patients with arterial thromboembolism and confirmed COVID-19 were identified. Median age was 67 years (58-75) and 37 (76%) were male. The most common preexisting conditions were hypertension (53%) and diabetes (35%). Median D-dimer level was 2673 ng/mL (723-7139). The distribution of thromboembolic events included upper 7 (14%) and lower 35 (71%) extremity ischemia, bowel ischemia 2 (4%), and cerebral ischemia 5 (10%). Six patients (12%) had thrombus in multiple locations. Concomitant deep vein thrombosis was found in 8 patients (16%). Twenty-two (45%) patients presented with signs of acute arterial ischemia and were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. The remaining 27 (55%) developed ischemia during hospitalization. Revascularization was performed in 13 (27%) patients, primary amputation in 5 (10%), administration of systemic tissue plasminogen activator in 3 (6%), and 28 (57%) were treated with systemic anticoagulation only. The rate of limb loss was 18%. Twenty-one patients (46%) died in the hospital. Twenty-five (51%) were successfully discharged and 3 patients are still in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: While the mechanism of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear, the occurrence of such complication is associated with acute arterial ischemia which results in a high limb loss and mortality."
COVID-19 target: A specific target for novel coronavirus detection,"An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus has been reported worldwide and become a global health problem; hence, the diagnosis and differentiation of this virus from other types of coronavirus is essential to control of the disease. To this end, the analysis of genomics data plays a vital role in introducing a stronger target and consequently provides better results in laboratory examinations. The modified comparative genomics approach helps us to find novel specific targets by comparing two or more sequences on the nucleotide collection database. We, for the first time, detected ORF8 gene as a potential target for the detection of the novel coronavirus. Unlike previous reported genes (RdRP, E and N genes), ORF8 is entirely specific to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and has no cross-reactivity with other kinds of coronavirus. Accordingly, ORF8 gene can be used as an additional confirmatory assay."
Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning in Intra-Abdominal Cancer Surgery (RIPCa): A Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial,"There is limited evidence on the effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) following non-cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of RIPC on morbidity following intra-abdominal cancer surgery. We conducted a double blinded pilot randomised controlled trial that included 47 patients undergoing surgery for gynaecological, pancreatic and colorectal malignancies. The patients were randomized into an intervention (RIPC) or control group. RIPC was provided by intermittent inflations of an upper limb tourniquet. The primary outcome was feasibility of the study, and the main secondary outcome was postoperative morbidity including perioperative troponin change and the urinary biomarkers tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (TIMP-2*IGFBP-7). The recruitment target was reached, and the protocol procedures were followed. The intervention group developed fewer surgical complications at 30 days (4.5% vs. 33%), 90 days (9.5% vs. 35%) and 6 months (11% vs. 41%) (adjusted p 0.033, 0.044 and 0.044, respectively). RIPC was a significant independent variable for lower overall postoperative morbidity survey (POMS) score, OR 0.79 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.99) and fewer complications at 6 months including pulmonary OR 0.2 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.92), surgical OR 0.12 (95% CI 0.007 to 0.89) and overall complications, OR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.74). There was no difference in perioperative troponin change or TIMP2*IGFBP-7. Our pilot study suggests that RIPC may improve outcomes following intra-abdominal cancer surgery and that a larger trial would be feasible."

Fighting the invisible enemy: providing support and structure to radiology resident during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The objective of this article is to share the strategy we used in order to restructure the radiology and diagnostic imaging department of a referral institution during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, on the basis of the current recommendations. It is essential to integrate the work of supervisors, preceptors, and residents, maintaining communication and sharing decisions, with mutual support, as well as to determine the best strategy to be adopted in this scenario of uncertainty and constant change, while also ensuring adequate emotional support for all parties."
Experience of Community Neurologists Providing Care for Patients With Neurodegenerative Illness During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"OBJECTIVE: Health care delivery systems transformed rapidly at the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to slow the spread of the virus while identifying novel methods for providing care. In many ways, the pandemic affected both persons with neurologic illness and neurologists. This study describes the perspectives and experiences of community neurologists providing care for patients with neurodegenerative illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study with 20 community neurologists from a multisite comparative-effectiveness trial of outpatient palliative care from July 23, 2020, to November 11, 2020. Participants were interviewed individually about the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on their professional and personal lives. Interviews were analyzed with matrix analysis to identify key themes. RESULTS: Four main themes illustrated the impact of the pandemic on community neurologists: (1) challenges of the current political climate, (2) lack of support for new models of care, (3) being on the frontline of suffering, and (4) clinician self-care. Taken together, the themes capture the unusual environment in which community neurologists practice, the lack of clinician trust among some patients, patient and professional isolation, and opportunities to support quality care delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic politics created an environment that made care provision challenging for community neurologists. Efforts to improve care delivery should proactively work to reduce clinician burnout while incorporating support for new models of care adopted due to the pandemic. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03076671."
Evaluation of S-RBD and high specificity ACE-2-binding antibodies on SARS-CoV-2 patients after six months from infection,"The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet fully defined, but the availability of sensitive and specific serological assays is crucial to observe the presence of specific antibodies against the human receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and high specificity ACE-2-binding antibodies or neutralizing antibodies (NT) in response to vaccines. Indeed, these peculiar antibodies should prevent viral interaction between RBD and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, located on surface of host cells. In this study, 72 samples from 37 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 35 not-hospitalized patients were analyzed longitudinally. The detection of S-RBD and NT antibodies was carried out using CLIA tests. Hospitalized patients showed elevated serum levels of S-RBD (97.22%) and NT (77.78%) antibodies, differently, not-hospitalized, who were paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic patients, showed lower serum levels of S-RBD (65.71%) and NT (38.14%) antibodies. The results suggest that the NT serum level is strongly related to disease severity (p < 0.001) and to the serum level of S-RBD antibodies (p < 0.0001)."

Pathological Findings and Management of COVID-19 Patients: A Brief Overview of Modern-day Pandemic,"Today the world is facing one of the deadliest pandemics caused by COVID-19. This highly transmissible virus has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. It acts by attaching to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) with the help of glycoprotein spikes, which it uses as a receptor. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; rt-PCR) is the gold standard diagnostic test, and chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan are the other main investigations. Several medications and passive immunization are in use to treat the condition. We searched using PubMed and Google Scholar using keywords such as COVID-19, coronavirus, and their combination with pathological findings, clinical features, management, and treatment to search for relevant published literature. After the removal of duplications and the selection of only published English literature from the past five years, we had a total of 31 papers to review. Most of the COVID-19 affected patients have mild pneumonia symptoms, and those with severe disease have comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 had pathological findings, like ground-glass opacities, consolidations, pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells. Radiological changes show lung changes such as consolidations and opacities, and the pathological findings were infiltration of inflammatory cells and hyalinization. Patients with mild symptoms should self-quarantine, whereas those with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are treated in the hospital. Medications under trial include antivirals, antibacterials, antimalarials, and passive immunization. Supportive treatment such as oxygen therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and ventilator support can also be used. The symptoms shown by patients are very mild and self-limiting. There is no definitive treatment, although a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have shown good results, and passive immunization also shows promising results, their safety profile is yet to be studied in detail."
Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum Associated with COVID-19 Pneumonia,"The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared in December in Wuhan, before becoming a global pandemic in a few weeks. Several complications of this infection have been reported. However, a spontaneous pneumomediastinum has rarely been described. We report the fourth case of this extremely rare complication in a 65-year-old male patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, discovered during his therapeutic management by a CT scan control."
Will Covid-19 put the public back in public transport? A UK perspective,Covid-19 has had a major impact on public transport systems across the world. Public financial support has been needed to maintain services in the face of drastically reduced ridership and adjustment to the need for social distancing. This paper explores the challenge this poses to current methods of delivery of public transport services and argues that a simple return to the status quo is unlikely as public transport adjusts to a new normal of more home working and fear of crowded spaces. In turn this impacts most on the transport disadvantaged. The paper argues that this may spell the end of the prevailing model of a deregulated competitive public transport that has prevailed in the United Kingdom and require a major rethinking of the way to provide an efficient and effective transport system. Such a rethink will depend on understanding the interplay of private and social norms and building public trust.
Psychological Effects of COVID-19 and Its Measures in Nepalese Medical Students,"Having to listen to the devastating daily news brought by COVID-19 since the first case was reported on 23rd January 2020 in Nepal, it has pushed the country into various crises. The issue of psychological health has been overlooked during this crisis.COVID-19 has sabotaged the psychological health of general people and more importantly medical students. It has disrupted the academics and clinical rotations of medical education. The prospect of being the future health care personnel without adequate training has destroyed the confidence and aspiration andin addition, joining the frontline against this type of deadly virus with little preparedness has instilled fear and uncertainty among them. So, concerning the context, this article focuses on the psychological effects faced by medical students and some ways to overcome this issue."
"Recombinant Canine Coronaviruses in Dogs, Europe","Coronaviruses of potential recombinant origin with porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), referred to as a new subtype (IIb) of canine coronavirus (CCoV), were recently identified in dogs in Europe. To assess the distribution of the TGEV-like CCoV subtype, during 2001–2008 we tested fecal samples from dogs with gastroenteritis. Of 1,172 samples, 493 (42.06%) were positive for CCoV. CCoV-II was found in 218 samples, and CCoV-I and CCoV-II genotypes were found in 182. Approximately 20% of the samples with CCoV-II had the TGEV-like subtype; detection rates varied according to geographic origin. The highest and lowest rates of prevalence for CCoV-II infection were found in samples from Hungary and Greece (96.87% and 3.45%, respectively). Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the CCoV-IIb strains were related to prototype TGEV-like strains in the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the spike protein gene."
Saving Lives Versus Saving Dollars: The Acceptable Loss for Coronavirus Disease 2019,
Job Demands and Job Resources of Academics in Higher Education,"Too many job demands and not enough job resources can negatively influence the well-being of employees. Currently, limited information exists surrounding the job demands and resources as experienced by academic employees in the higher education sector. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the job demands and job resources experienced by academic employees using qualitative methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 academic employees, using an Interpretative Phenomenological Approach. Thematic analysis, specifically template analysis was used to categorize the themes. Job demands were divided into three categories: quantitative (publication pressure, overburdened with the load, and competing time demands), qualitative (work/home balance, complexity of student support, organizational politics, and lack of mental health support) and organizational demands (using technology-mediated learning and lack of structural resources). Job resources were organized into two categories: organizational (social support) and personal resources (autonomy, meaningful work, and personal support). Participant experiences are highlighted to provide a better understanding of the job demands and job resources encountered. The framework of job demands and job resources gleaned from the study could be used for further research to manage and monitor motivational processes for academic staff, and to reduce strain due to high job demands."

Should We Aim to Create a Perfect Healthy Utopia? Discussions of Ethical Issues Surrounding the World of Project Itoh’s Harmony,"To consider whether or not we should aim to create a perfect healthy utopia on Earth, we focus on the SF novel Harmony (2008), written by Japanese writer Project Ito, and analyze various issues in the world established in the novel from a bioethical standpoint. In the world depicted in Harmony, preserving health and life is a top priority. Super-medicine is realized through highly advanced medical technologies. Citizens in Harmony are required to strictly control themselves to achieve perfect health and must always disclose their health information to the public and continuously prove their health. From a bioethical standpoint, the world in Harmony is governed by a “healthy longevity supremacy” principle, with being healthy equated to being good and right. Privacy no longer exists, as it is perceived ethical for citizens to openly communicate health-related information to establish one’s credibility. Moreover, there is no room for self-determination concerning healthcare because medical interventions and care are completely routinized, automated, centralized, and instantly provided. This is a situation where the community exhibits extremely powerful and effective paternalism. One can argue that healthy longevity is highly preferred. But is it right to aim for a perfectly healthy society at all costs? Should we sacrifice freedom, privacy, vivid feelings, and personal dignity to achieve such a world? In our view, the answer is no, as this would require the loss of many essential values. We conclude by proposing an alternative governing principle for future healthcare, and refer to it as the “do-everything-in-moderation” principle."
Machine learning prediction of 3CL(pro) SARS-CoV-2 docking scores,"Molecular docking results of two training sets containing 866 and 8,696 compounds were used to train three different machine learning (ML) approaches. Neural network approaches according to the Keras and TensorFlow libraries and the gradient boosted decision trees approach of XGBoost were used with DScribe’s Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions molecular descriptors. In addition, neural networks using the SchNetPack library and descriptors were used. The ML performance was tested on three different sets, including compounds for future organic synthesis. The final evaluation of the ML predicted docking scores was based on the ZINC in vivo set, from which 1,200 compounds were randomly selected with respect to their size. The results obtained showed a consistent ML prediction capability of docking scores, and even though compounds with more than 60 atoms were found slightly overestimated they remain valid for a subsequent evaluation of their drug repurposing suitability."

Changes in COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies in emergency medical technicians (EMTs),"INTRODUCTION: Serologic testing can provide a safe and fast approach for assessing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These tests can be utilized as a complementary method in diagnosis and patients' follow-up, and can also be helpful in epidemiological studies. This study aimed to describe temporal changes in the incidence of COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies in emergency medical technicians (EMTs) within a specified time period. METHODS: All EMTs working for Tehran Emergency Medical Service (EMS) center during May to September 2020 were eligible for this study. Those EMTs who were suspected/probable/confirmed cases of COVID-19, based on WHO defined criteria and were willing to participate, entered the study. The EMTs underwent serology testing four weeks after the occurrence of exposure (in suspected cases) or onset of their symptoms (in probable/confirmed cases). Cases were further confirmed by RT-PCR and/or lung CT, and antibody testing was performed for the second and third time with 12-week intervals. Finger-stick blood sampling was utilized for the specimen collection in three different phases. Samples were then analyzed by a commercial immunochromatography-based kit for qualitative measurement of serum IgM and IgG antibodies against the COVID-19 S-protein antigen. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-four participants met the inclusion criteria; their mean age was 35.9 (SD = 7.6) years and consisted of 244 (85.9%) males. COVID-19 was confirmed in 169 out of 284 participants. Subsequently, 142 and 122 participants were included in phases 2 and 3 of the study, respectively. The number of seronegative patients exceeded seropositive ones in all three phases. At baseline, 162 (57%) patients were seronegative, 27 (9.5%) were only positive for IgG, 3 (1.1%) were only positive for IgM, and 92 (32.4%) were positive for both antibodies; Seventy-eight (54.9%) were seronegative, and 31 (21.8%) were positive for both antibodies in the second phase; These values were 85 (69.6%) and 8 (6.6%) for the third phase, respectively. Among the people who were positive IgG in the first phase (80 people), 56.3% were still positive in the second phase and 27.5% in both subsequent phases. CONCLUSION: The results of our study show that there is a significant reduction in COVID-19 antibody seropositivity over time."

Collective Response to Media Coverage of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Reddit and Wikipedia: Mixed-Methods Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The exposure and consumption of information during epidemic outbreaks may alter people’s risk perception and trigger behavioral changes, which can ultimately affect the evolution of the disease. It is thus of utmost importance to map the dissemination of information by mainstream media outlets and the public response to this information. However, our understanding of this exposure-response dynamic during the COVID-19 pandemic is still limited. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to characterize the media coverage and collective internet response to the COVID-19 pandemic in four countries: Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. METHODS: We collected a heterogeneous data set including 227,768 web-based news articles and 13,448 YouTube videos published by mainstream media outlets, 107,898 user posts and 3,829,309 comments on the social media platform Reddit, and 278,456,892 views of COVID-19–related Wikipedia pages. To analyze the relationship between media coverage, epidemic progression, and users’ collective web-based response, we considered a linear regression model that predicts the public response for each country given the amount of news exposure. We also applied topic modelling to the data set using nonnegative matrix factorization. RESULTS: Our results show that public attention, quantified as user activity on Reddit and active searches on Wikipedia pages, is mainly driven by media coverage; meanwhile, this activity declines rapidly while news exposure and COVID-19 incidence remain high. Furthermore, using an unsupervised, dynamic topic modeling approach, we show that while the levels of attention dedicated to different topics by media outlets and internet users are in good accordance, interesting deviations emerge in their temporal patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings offer an additional key to interpret public perception and response to the current global health emergency and raise questions about the effects of attention saturation on people’s collective awareness and risk perception and thus on their tendencies toward behavioral change."
Antiproliferative and apoptosis inducing effect of essential oil extracted from Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith leaves,"Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith is an endemic species in China, which has been proved to be an important Chinese herbal medicine. However, chemical composition and bioactivity of essential oil (EO) of C. fortumei (J.) Smith leaves remain unclear. In present study, we isolated EO from the plant by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction assay (SFE-CO(2)), and investigated on cancer cells MGC-803, MCF-7, BGC-823, Bcap-37, A375, and A549 in vitro by MTT assay. 26 compounds were identified by GC–MS analysis, and the EO showed significant antitumor activities against MGC-803, Bcap-37, and A549 cancer cell lines (IC(50) values ranging from 0.15 to 0.24 mg/mL), and the activities of its main component were also studied. Subsequent fluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated that the EO could induce apoptosis in MGC-803, Bcap-37, and A549 cell lines, and the apoptosis ratios reached 26.44 % after 48 h of treatment at 0.15 mg/mL in MGC-803 cells. Caspase 3 activity in MGC-803 cells was also determined when the cells treated with the oil, and the activity of caspase 3 enzyme was increased compared to the control. This study suggests that the EO isolated from C. fortumei (J.) Smith could inhibit the growth of human carcinoma cells, and it could induce apoptosis of cancer cells. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00044-014-1244-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."
Barriers and enablers to implementing telehealth consultations in psycho-oncology,"OBJECTIVE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, use of telehealth to deliver care was recommended across the Australian health system. This study aims to explore the barriers and enablers to delivery of psycho-oncology services via telehealth and attitudes to use of telehealth in psycho-oncology. METHODS: Twenty-one psycho-oncology clinicians participated in semi-structured telephone interviews. Transcribed interviews were thematically analysed using the framework method. RESULTS: Three key themes were identified which described the overall experience of delivering psycho-oncology services via telehealth: (1) Context Matters-for whom is telehealth effective, when is it less effective; (2) Therapy content and telehealth implementation; (3) Recommendations for Sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: These insights into the barriers and enablers to delivering psycho-oncology services via telehealth inform future research and clinical practice. While there is support for the continued use of telehealth in psycho-oncology, there are significant improvements needed to ensure effective implementation and continued benefit."
"Virologic and serologic surveillance for human, swine and avian influenza virus infections among pigs in the north-central United States","Influenza virus infection in pigs is both an animal health problem and a public health concern. As such, surveillance and characterization of influenza viruses in swine is important to the veterinary community and should be a part of human pandemic preparedness planning. Studies in 1976/1977 and 1988/1989 demonstrated that pigs in the U.S. were commonly infected with classical swine H1N1 viruses, whereas human H3 and avian influenza virus infections were very rare. In contrast, human H3 and avian H1 viruses have been isolated frequently from pigs in Europe and Asia over the last two decades. From September 1997 through August 1998, we isolated 26 influenza viruses from pigs in the north-central United States at the point of slaughter. All 26 isolates were H1N1 viruses, and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes from 11 representative viruses demonstrated that these were classical swine H1 viruses. However, monoclonal antibody analyses revealed antigenic heterogeneity among the HA proteins of the 26 viruses. Serologically, 27.7% of 2,375 pigs tested had hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against classical swine H1 influenza virus. Of particular significance, however, the rates of seropositivity to avian H1 (7.6%) and human H3 (8.0%) viruses were substantially higher than in previous studies."
Application of pooled testing in screening and estimating the prevalence of Covid-19,"The recent emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented healthcare challenge and catastrophic economic and social consequences to the countries across the world. The situation is even worse for emerging economies like India. WHO recommends mass scale testing as one of the most effective ways to contain its spread and fight the pandemic. But, due to the high cost and shortage of test kits, specifically in India, the testing is restricted to only those who are symptomatic. In this context, pooled testing is recommended by some experts as a partial solution to overcome this problem. In this article, we explain the basic statistical theory behind the pooled testing procedure for screening as well as prevalence estimation. In real world situations, the tests are imperfect, and lead to false positive and false negative results. We provide theoretical explanation of the impact of these diagnostic errors on the performances of individual testing and pooled testing procedures. Finally, we study the effect of misspecification of sensitivity and specificity of tests on the estimate of prevalence, an issue, which is debated a lot among the scientists in the context of COVID-19. Our theoretical investigations lead to some interesting and precise understanding of some of these issues."
Coronapod: How Delta is changing the game,
What makes a hydrogel‐based dressing advantageous for the prevention of medical device‐related pressure ulcers,"The synergistic influences of geometrical, mechanical and thermal mismatches between a skin‐contacting medical device and the skin may cause tissue stress concentrations and sharp temperature gradients, both of which contribute to the risk for medical device‐related pressure ulcers. In this work, we developed an innovative, integrated experimental bioengineering approach encompassing mechanical stiffness, friction and thermal property studies for testing the biomechanical suitability of a hydrogel‐based dressing in prophylaxis of injuries caused by devices. We characterised the viscoelastic stress relaxation of the dressing and determined its long‐term elastic modulus. We further measured the coefficient of friction of the hydrogel‐based dressing at dressing‐device and skin‐dressing interfaces, using a tilting‐table tribometer. Lastly, we measured the thermal conductivity of the dressing, using a heat‐flow meter and infrared thermography‐based method. All measurements considered dry and moist conditions, the latter simulating skin perspiration effects. Our results revealed that the long‐term stiffness and the thermal conductivity of the hydrogel‐based dressing matched the corresponding properties of human skin for both dry and moist conditions. The dressing further demonstrated a relatively high coefficient of friction at its skin‐facing and device‐facing aspects, indicating minimal frictional sliding. All these properties make the above dressing advantageous for prevention of device‐related injuries."
Caring for patients with pain during the COVID‐19 pandemic: consensus recommendations from an international expert panel,"Chronic pain causes significant suffering, limitation of daily activities and reduced quality of life. Infection from COVID‐19 is responsible for an ongoing pandemic that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, leading to systemic complications and death. Led by the World Health Organization, healthcare systems across the world are engaged in limiting the spread of infection. As a result, all elective surgical procedures, outpatient procedures and patient visits, including pain management services, have been postponed or cancelled. This has affected the care of chronic pain patients. Most are elderly with multiple comorbidities, which puts them at risk of COVID‐19 infection. Important considerations that need to be recognised during this pandemic for chronic pain patients include: ensuring continuity of care and pain medications, especially opioids; use of telemedicine; maintaining biopsychosocial management; use of anti‐inflammatory drugs; use of steroids; and prioritising necessary procedural visits. There are no guidelines to inform physicians and healthcare providers engaged in caring for patients with pain during this period of crisis. We assembled an expert panel of pain physicians, psychologists and researchers from North America and Europe to formulate recommendations to guide practice. As the COVID‐19 situation continues to evolve rapidly, these recommendations are based on the best available evidence and expert opinion at this present time and may need adapting to local workplace policies."
Profiling of immune dysfunction in COVID-19 patients allows early prediction of disease progression,"With a rising incidence of COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality worldwide, it is critical to elucidate the innate and adaptive immune responses that drive disease severity. We performed longitudinal immune profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 patients and healthy donors. We observed a dynamic immune landscape of innate and adaptive immune cells in disease progression and absolute changes of lymphocyte and myeloid cells in severe versus mild cases or healthy controls. Intubation and death were coupled with selected natural killer cell KIR receptor usage and IgM+ B cells and associated with profound CD4 and CD8 T-cell exhaustion. Pseudo-temporal reconstruction of the hierarchy of disease progression revealed dynamic time changes in the global population recapitulating individual patients and the development of an eight-marker classifier of disease severity. Estimating the effect of clinical progression on the immune response and early assessment of disease progression risks may allow implementation of tailored therapies."
Panthera tigris jacksoni Population Crash and Impending Extinction due to Environmental Perturbation and Human-Wildlife Conflict,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The Malayan tiger, with less than 200 individuals in Malaysia, is in an intermediate population crash. Anthropogenic disturbances (poaching, roadkill, and human–tiger conflict), environmental perturbation (decreasing habitat quality), and infectious diseases have been identified as factors leading to impending extinction. Preliminary findings from stakeholders indicate Peninsular Malaysia has an existing Malayan Tiger conservation management programme. However, to enhance the protection and conservation of the Malayan Tiger, the authority should re-assess the existing legislation, regulation, and management plan, and realign them to prevent population decline. ABSTRACT: The critically endangered Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni), with an estimated population of less than 200 individuals left in isolated rainforest habitats in Malaysia, is in an intermediate population crash leading to extinction in the next decade. The population has decreased significantly by illegal poaching, environmental perturbation, roadkill, and being captured during human–wildlife conflicts. Forty-five or more individuals were extracted from the wild (four animals captured due to conflict, one death due to canine distemper, one roadkilled, and 39 poached) in the 12 years between 2008–2019. The Malayan tigers are the first wildlife species to test positive for COVID-19 and are subject to the Canine Distemper Virus. These anthropogenic disturbances (poaching and human–tiger conflict) and environmental perturbation (decreasing habitat coverage and quality) have long been identified as impending extinction factors. Roadkill and infectious diseases have emerged recently as new confounding factors threatening Malayan tiger extinction in the near future. Peninsular Malaysia has an existing Malayan tiger conservation management plan; however, to enhance the protection and conservation of Malayan tigers from potential extinction, the authority should reassess the existing legislation, regulation, and management plan and realign them to prevent further population decline, and to better enable preparedness and readiness for the ongoing pandemic and future threats."
Global research trends in West Nile virus from 1943 to 2016: a bibliometric analysis,"BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging infectious disease which is most commonly transmitted to humans through mosquito, and is considered a major public-health problem worldwide. The aim of the current study is to bibliometrically analyze the quantity and quality of publications indexed in Scopus from different countries to reveal the characteristics of global research output regarding WNV. METHODS: This study is a bibliometric analysis based on the Scopus database. This study focused on identifying WNV publication trends with regard to publication year, publication type, prolific countries, language of publication, as well as, prolific journals, citations, and collaboration patterns. RESULTS: A total of 4729 publications were considered in this study, which were published between 1943 and 2016. The annual quantity of literature published before 2000 followed a low rate of research growth; while the quantity of publications after 2000 were published in a stage of rapid development. The country with the greatest number of publications in WNV research field was the USA with 2304 (48.7%) publications, followed by France with 224 (4.7%) publications, and Canada with 222 (4.7%) publications. Contributions from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) were considerably small, that is, (n = 519 publications; 11%). All publications related to WNV achieved h-index of 140 and were cited 124,222 times. The median [interquartile range] number of citations per article thus amounts to 9 [2-28]. The USA had the highest h-index of 131. Emerging Infectious Diseases is the most productive journal with 227 articles, followed by Journal of Virology with 162 publications. The result designated that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was ranked the first in terms of publication output, followed by National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. CONCLUSIONS: There is an obvious trend of WNV research after 2000, and countries with high income have more contributions in WNV research field. The research output is low among LMIC. The USA produced the largest number of publications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention obtained the leading position of the institutions in terms of publication output. In general, this study not only presents a full view of global WNV research, but also can contribute for future further research in this field."
471. Descriptive Analysis of Multiinflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Secondary to COVID 19 Infection in a Predominantly Latino Population in Western Massachusetts,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection is usually mild in children. Progression to severe disease with multiple organ systems compromise described as Multi Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a rare occurrence believed to be immunologically mediated. Previous reports describe a possible link between children of Latino origin and high incidence of MIS-C in the US. 40% of the total population in Western Massachusetts is of Latino origin. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 30 children admitted to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts from April 2020-June 2021 meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for MIS-C. Demographics, laboratory data, and clinical outcomes including progression to Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) were analyzed. RESULTS: 60% of children were Hispanic. Mean age (9.1 yrs). Range (3m-20 yrs). COVID PCR positive (78%) and COVID Antibody positive (68%). The most common symptom was fever (96.8%) followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (84%). Respiratory symptoms (29%), dermatological manifestations (39%). Most common comorbidity, asthma (19%) followed by obesity (17%). Leukocytosis (47%), lymphopenia (45%), Anemia (55%), thrombocytopenia (20%), high CRP (90%), ferritinemia (57%), acute kidney injury (20%), elevated liver enzymes (53%), 52% children had electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, 34% had abnormal echocardiograms, none displayed coronary artery dilation. Progression to MAS (20%). All patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin G, steroids, aspirin, and anakinra (IL1 receptor antagonist) if progression to MAS. All patients survived. CONCLUSION: In our population, gastrointestinal symptoms were predominant despite a high prevalence of asthma and obesity, previous reports of children with MIS-C describe predominance of respiratory manifestations. We did not encounter any coronary aneurysms during admission. Most children had positive PCR or Antibodies for COVID 19 and showed important abnormalities in multiple cell lines and inflammatory markers. More research is needed to fully understand ethnical risk factors associated with disease severity especially the risk of progression to MAS from MIS-C in children of Latino origin diagnosed with COVID 19 infection.

One-year multicenter evaluation of a new hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens with hydroxyethyl methacrylate in an automated preloaded delivery system,"To assess a single-piece monofocal hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) (Clareon) contained in automated preloaded delivery system (AutonoMe). SETTING: 18 surgical sites in Japan. DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS: In patients undergoing phacoemulsification and IOL implantation of a new hydrophobic acrylic IOL using an automated injector, clinical data were collected preoperatively and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. The degree of glistenings was graded on a 4-point scale. The surgeons rated usability and performance of the IOL delivery system on a 5-point scale. RESULTS: The study enrolled 384 eyes of 384 patients, ranging in age from 41 to 93 (73.8 ± 8.2, mean ± SD) years. The percentage of eyes with corrected distance visual acuity of 20/25 or better at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively was 82.6%, 91.9%, 92.8%, 96.6%, and 95.2%, respectively. Refractive error was within 1.0 diopter in approximately 90% of cases. No glistenings were found in all cases throughout the study period. The rate of Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was 0.9% at 1 year. The IOL delivery system received high ratings on its usability and performance by the surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: The new hydrophobic acrylic IOL with HEMA showed excellent visual and refractive outcomes without developing glistenings throughout the 1-year study period. The surgeons gave high marks for usability and performance of the automated preloaded delivery system."
Take care or “German Angst”? Lessons from cancer care during COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020,"OBJECTIVE: While the second wave of COVID-19 has started in Europe, data are still missing on the consequences of the first one for patients with cancer. The aim of our study was to learn more about the experiences of German patients and staff in the oncology services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted among cancer patients and their therapists (physicians, medical staff, psychologists, spiritual care givers) in Germany between April and May 2020 asking about burden, fears, and perceived changes in German oncology service system. Besides answer frequencies of different stakeholders, uni- and multivariate analyses were performed for selected items to identify areas of high impact. RESULTS: In total 752 participants were included. All groups have identified high mental burden as central problem. A majority was confused about varying information policies and strategies against the pandemic. Patient reported restricted visits, isolation and delay of treatment as central fears and problems. The majority of fears could be coped by the health care workers. The patients describe processes at the oncology services during the first wave. Personal experiences with COVID-19 have had no influence on the felt burden of the patients. Physicians, medical staff, psychologists and spiritual care givers were extremely stressed but repressed their own burden. They await financial, physical and mental problems for their own future. CONCLUSIONS: The presented personal views and experiences allow focusing the discussions about heath care systems during the on-going pandemic. Support for health care workers, as much routine as possible in oncology services, and transparency in information will be the keys for good management in futural situations of crisis.

The brief comparison of the operational efficiency of pool-testing strategies for COVID-19 mass testing in PCR laboratories,"This paper addresses the operational efficiency of different pool-testing strategies in typical scenarios of a PCR laboratory working in mass testing for COVID-19 with different values of prevalence, limitations and conditions of testing, and priorities of optimization. The research employs a model of the laboratory's testing process, created after interviewing of PCR laboratories and studying their operations. The limitations and operational characteristics of this model were applied in a simulation of the testing process with different pool-testing strategies managed by a computer program developed in the LOMT project. The efficiency indicators assessed are the number of assays needed to obtain results of a batch of specimens, the number of specimens identified after the first analysis, and total time to obtain all results. Depending on prevalence, constraints of testing, and priorities of optimization, different pool-testing strategies provide the best operational efficiency. The binary splitting algorithm provides the maximum reduction of the number of assays: from 1.99x reduction for a high prevalence (10%) to 25x reduction for a low prevalence (0.1%), while other algorithms provide the least amount of time to obtain results or the maximum number of the specimens classified after the first analysis."

Impact of COVID Pandemic and Hybrid teaching on Final year MBBS students’ End of clerkship Exam performance,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The novel coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2) pandemic has revolutionized medical education worldwide. Most medical schools have adopted the online teaching and assessments. Students attending modified clerkships and assessments under the stress of the pandemic, perform and score differently when compared to normal clerkships. We aimed to identify the impact of COVID-19 on final year MBBS students’ EOC (End of Clerkship) examination by comparing them with their scores prior to the COVID and with scores of the previous final year. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Shifa College of Medicine. Final year MBBS students’ scores of years 2019 and 2020 were included. Students’ EOC MCQ and OSCE scores were compared in pre-COVID and COVID affected rotations of the same year and with the previous year (2019). Data were analyzed in SPSS version 21, means scores were calculated, and one-way ANOVA was applied. Pearson correlation was calculated for correlation assessment of MCQ and OSCE scores. RESULTS: There were 118 students. The mean EOC, OSCE, and MCQ scores in rotations one to four were 72.8±6.4, 73.3± 8.1, 71.6± 7.4, 72.7± 6.7 and 44.4± 8, 47.2± 8.4, 46.1± 8.2, 48.8± 8.1, respectively. One-way ANOVA results before and after COVID lockdown were statistically insignificant (p=0.3) for OSCE and significant for MCQ in the final year class of 2020 (p=0.001). The Pearson correlation assessment between MCQ and OSCE scores (n=416) had a significant positive correlation (r=0.42, p=0.000). The overall comparison between scores of the final year class of 2019 and 2020 showed significant improvement in Surgery and Obstetrics/Gynae scores in 2020. CONCLUSION: During the COVID pandemic, the final year students’ performance in EOC MCQ and OSCE over all remained unaffected."
Different approach to medical decision-making in difficult circumstances: Kittay's Ethics of Care.,"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated advances in bioethical approaches to medical decision-making. This paper develops an alternative method for rationing care during periods of resource scarcity. Typical approaches to triaging rely on utilitarian calculations; however, this approach introduces a problematic antihumanist sentiment, inviting the proposition of alternative schemata. As such, we suggest a feminist approach to medical decision-making, founded in and expanding upon the framework of Eva Kittay's Ethics of Care. We suggest that this new structure addresses the issue of medical decision-making during times of resource scarcity just as well as pure utilitarian approaches while better attending to their significant theoretical concerns, forming a coherent alternative to the current bioethical consensus."
"Study protocol for the St James's Hospital, Tallaght University Hospital, Trinity College Dublin Allied Researchers' (STTAR) Bioresource for COVID-19","Background: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in Ireland with the first confirmed positive case in March 2020. In the early stages of the pandemic clinicians and researchers in two affiliated Dublin hospitals identified the need for a COVID-19 biobanking initiative to support and enhance research into the disease. Through large scale analysis of clinical, regional, and genetic characteristics of COVID-19 patients, biobanks have helped identify, and so protect, at risk patient groups The STTAR Bioresource has been created to collect and store data and linked biological samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and healthy and disease controls. Aim: The primary objective of this study is to build a biobank, to understand the clinical characteristics and natural history of COVID-19 infection with the long-term goal of research into improved disease understanding, diagnostic tests and treatments. Methods: This is a prospective dual-site cohort study across two tertiary acute university teaching hospitals. Patients are recruited from inpatient wards or outpatient clinics. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection as well as healthy and specific disease control groups are recruited. Biological samples are collected and a case report form detailing demographic and medical background is entered into the bespoke secure online Dendrite database. Impact: The results of this study will be used to inform national and international strategy on health service provision and disease management related to COVID-19. In common with other biobanks, study end points evolve over time as new research questions emerge. They currently include patient survival, occurrence of severe complications of the disease or its therapy, occurrence of persistent symptoms following recovery from the acute illness and vaccine responses."
